      "Full text: MY FIRST EXPERIENCE with city cycling wasn't promising. The suburban rides of my childhood hadn't prepared me for crumbling concrete, hulking cargo trucks and hostile drivers. By the time I moved to New York City six years ago, biking seemed absurd.\n",
      "At the start of the pandemic, however, traffic vanished from my neighborhood in Brooklyn and it seemed like everyone took to two wheels. The New York City Department of Transportation reported it tracked 33% more bike trips year-over-year between May and December of 2020. Recently, I realized I was tired of being too scared to join the new wave of cyclists.\n",
      "The data wasn't encouraging. American streets are dangerous places, even in a two-ton box of steel. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said the U.S. had the highest per capita rate of deaths from road accidents among the 38 countries from its data set in 2021, the most recent year for which it has statistics.\n",
      "Explore buy side from WSJ\n",
      "And cyclists face considerable threats. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported that fatal injuries to cyclists went up by 9.2% between 2019 and 2020, and by another 5.2% by the end of the 2021. Sheryl Porter, a 52-year-old stay-at-home mom in Grand Prairie, Texas, told me drivers sometimes play \"Chicken\" with her. More chilling, Mark Lowe, 49, a physician assistant in Aurora, Colo., said he once had a driver ride beside him, roll down his window and aim a handgun in his face.\n",
      "And yet, both bike a lot. Veon McReynolds, 71, a retired university administrator, said the key to staying safe is treating cars like dogs. \"If you come up to a dog and feel like it's going to bite you, you'll approach that dog a lot differently.\" He said even drivers in Houston, full of six-lane highways, respect cyclists who look comfortable and regularly look behind them.\n",
      "Dressing the part can also help. Though some studies indicate that drivers give cyclists with helmets less room, most people I talked to always wear one. Most also ride with front- and taillights, both to be more visible and ensure they can spot hazards.\n",
      "After buying a helmet, I borrowed a bike and tried projecting confidence in a small loop in my neighborhood. I'm sure I resembled a giraffe calf, awkwardly shifting my weight to find balance. But for the most part, car drivers gave me a wide berth. It felt a lot less scary than I'd imagined.\n",
      "For advice more-specific to New York, I took a lesson with Bike New York, a not-for-profit that hosts free classes for cyclists of all ages and experience levels. Rich Conroy, director of education, taught me how to make sure my bike was in good shape before I rode, watched me practice a graceful stop (the trick is to press down on your brakes gradually, not too hard or too quickly), and showed me how to deploy my bike's gears to crush hills.\n",
      "The most useful lesson, however, was the \"power start.\" When stopped at a light, put the foot of your dominant leg on the ground, and keep the other on the pedal, held parallel with the bottom tube. When the light turns green, push off the ground hard, then down on the pedal. You'll zoom.\n",
      "Since my lesson, I've encountered some unexpected annoyances like construction and tricky intersections. More than once, I've had to raise my voice to get the attention of a driver who was seemingly scrolling through TikTok. But I've avoided tragedy. I zipped down to a coffee shop to meet a friend. I corralled a group into crossing the Manhattan Bridge, with the promise of dumplings in Chinatown. Even pedaling to Bike Plant, a shop by my house, to buy gloves felt like an adventure.\n",
      "Of course, New York's bike infrastructure is relatively good. You can easily navigate from bike lane to bike lane. This wasn't the case circa 2000. \"Biking in New York City used to look like a cross between a '70s disaster film and 'Mad Max,'\" said Janette Sadik-Khan, currently a principal at Bloomberg Associates, a philanthropic consulting firm. Then the streets were filled with potholes, glass and loose gravel. In 2007, she became the NYC DOT commissioner, with a mandate to reshape the streets to be safer and more friendly to pedestrians, buses and cyclists.\n",
      "Ms. Sadik-Khan said she aimed to create connected networks of bike paths, so that you could go from path to path on your way anywhere, minimizing the amount of time you had to bike in the flow of car traffic. Since she left the department in 2013, the city has continued this work. New York now has over 1,500 miles of dedicated bike lanes. The proliferation has dramatically increased cycling traffic, but NYC DOT data collected between 2000 and 2018 indicates the infrastructure improvements have reduced the risk of severe injury and death to cyclists by 80% .\n",
      "Similar changes might be coming to streets near you in the wake of the pandemic biking boom. According to estimates from StreetLight Data, a mobility analytics research firm, at least 15 U.S. cities saw a staggering 50% year-over-year growth in bicycling between September 2019 and the same month in 2020, including centers like Omaha, Neb., Little Rock, Ark., and Birmingham, Ala.\n",
      "Streets in some cities have been closed to car traffic. All the while, splashy bike-lane projects are under way in places like Providence, R.I., and Bloomington, Ind.\n",
      "I'm ready to try them all. Especially now that it's spring.\n",
      "BELLS AND WHISTLES\n",
      "A few accessories to help keep you safe, and ensure you don't spend so much time fretting about losing your bike that you never leave home\n",
      "1. Agreeable Alerter\n",
      "If you haven't used a bell since your tricycle days, get oneâ€”they're an easy way to signal your presence to pedestrians and drivers. The Spurcycle Bell ($59) is remarkably resonant, which means people will even hear it from inside their SUVs.\n",
      "2. Hard Hat\n",
      "Many new helmets like the Giro Register ($70) are designed with an extra internal liner, which can minimize the amount of rotational forces your head experiences in a crash. Helmets with this feature will have a yellow sticker that says \"MIPS\" on the side. I've also been using an attached EVT Helmet Mirror ($40), which improves my spatial awareness, though it's no substitute for looking back.\n",
      "3. Theft Protection\n",
      "While you can certainly use a regular Bluetooth tracker like the Tile Sticker with your bike, the Knog Scout ($60) is designed to be mounted more stealthily. It's fully waterproof and can produce an extremely loud sound if you deem your bike lost.\n",
      "4. Pump it Up\n",
      "In the case of a flat tire, you'll always want to keep a patch kit (like the TT02 from Rema Tip Top ($3.50)) and bike pump on hand. The Topeak Mini ($40) is bitty and light (only 6 ounces), but has a foldout foot pad that makes it easy to use.\n",
      "5. Infinite Illumination\n",
      "Front and rear lighting help you both see and be seen. The Sinewave Beacon 2 ($350) is a front light that works in conjunction with a Dynamo hub, which, when installed to your wheel, captures some of the energy you use to pedal and converts it to electricity. This makes the Beacon a light you'll never have to recharge. Bonus: it has a USB port for juicing up your phone.\n",
      "6. Major Key\n",
      "It's a bad idea to leave your bike unlocked in the city, obviously. The Kryptonite New-U New York Lock ($148) features a double deadbolt. For thieves to get your bike, they would have to saw through each arm individually. Most won't bother with the hassle.\n",

      "Full text: Sam Altman, the 37-year-old startup-minting guru at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom , has long dreamed of a future in which computers could converse and learn like humans.\n",
      "One of his clearest childhood memories is sitting up late in his bedroom in suburban St. Louis, playing with the Macintosh LC II he had gotten for his eighth birthday when he had the sudden realization: \"Someday, the computer was going to learn to think,\" he said.\n",
      "In recent months, Mr. Altman has done more than anyone else to usher in this futureâ€”and commercialize it. OpenAI, the company he leads, in November released ChatGPT , the chatbot with an\n",
      "uncanny ability to produce humanlike writing that has become one of the most viral products in the history of technology. In the process, OpenAI went from a small nonprofit into a multibillion-dollar company , at near record speed, thanks in part to the launch of a for-profit arm that enabled it to raise $13 billion from Microsoft Corp., according to investor documents.\n",
      "This success has come as part of a delicate balancing act. Mr. Altman said he fears what could happen if AI is rolled out into society recklessly. He co-founded OpenAI eight years ago as a research nonprofit, arguing that it's uniquely dangerous to have profits be the main driver of developing powerful AI models.\n",
      "He is so wary of profit as an incentive in AI development that he has taken no direct financial stake in the business he built, he saidâ€”an anomaly in Silicon Valley, where founders of successful startups typically get rich off their equity.\n",
      "\"Like most other people, I like watching scores go up,\" when it comes to financial gains, he said. \"And I just like not having that be any factor at all.\" (The company said he earns a \"modest\" salary, but declined to disclose how much.) Mr. Altman said he has a small stake in a venture fund that invested in OpenAI, but that it is \"immaterial.\"\n",
      "Mr. Altman said he made \"more money than I could ever need\" early in his career, when he made a fortune investing in young startups. He owns three homes, including a mansion in San Francisco's Russian Hill neighborhood and a weekend home in Napa Valley, and employs a couple dozen to manage them and his family office of investments and nonprofits.\n",
      "During one of his last visits to his grandmother, who died last year, he bought her groceries and then admitted to his mother that he hadn't been to a grocery store in four or five years, she said.\n",
      "His goal, he said, is to forge a new world order in which machines free people to pursue more creative work. In his vision, universal basic incomeâ€”the concept of a cash stipend for everyone, no strings attachedâ€”helps compensate for jobs replaced by AI. Mr. Altman even thinks that humanity will love AI so much that an advanced chatbot could represent \"an extension of your will.\"\n",
      "In the long run, he said, he wants to set up a global governance structure that would oversee decisions about the future of AI and gradually reduce the power OpenAI's executive team has over its technology.\n",
      "Backers say his brand of social-minded capitalism makes him the ideal person to lead OpenAI. Others, including some who've worked for him, say he's too commercially minded and immersed in Silicon Valley thinking to lead a technological revolution that is already reshaping business and social life.\n",
      "The company signed a $10 billion deal with Microsoft in January that would allow the tech behemoth to own 49% of the company's for-profit entity, investor documents show. The corporate partnership, along with Mr. Altman's push to more aggressively commercialize its technology, have disillusioned key early leaders at OpenAI who felt the decisions violated an initial commitment to develop AI outside the influence of shareholders.\n",
      "One of OpenAI's critics has been Elon Musk, who co-founded the nonprofit in 2015 but parted ways in 2018 after a dispute over its control and direction. The Tesla Inc. CEO tweeted in February that OpenAI had been founded as an open-source nonprofit \"to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft. Not what I intended at all.\"\n",
      "Mr. Altman paused when asked about his co-founder's critique. \"I like Elon,\" he finally responded. \"I pay attention to what he has to say.\"\n",
      "In an open letter made public this week, Mr. Musk and other Silicon Valley luminaries, including Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a six-month pause for developing AI more advanced than GPT-4, the latest technology released by OpenAI in March, to stem a technological race that could spiral out of control.\n",
      "Mr. Altman said he doesn't necessarily need to be first to develop artificial general intelligence, a world long imagined by researchers and science-fiction writers where software isn't just good at one specific task like generating text or images but can understand and learn as well or better than a human can. He instead said OpenAI's ultimate mission is to build AGI, as it's called, safely.\n",
      "OpenAI has set profit caps for investors, with any returns beyond certain levelsâ€”from seven to 100 times what they put in, depending on how early they investedâ€”flowing to the nonprofit parent, according to investor documents. OpenAI and Microsoft also created a joint safety board, which includes Mr. Altman and Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott, that has the power to roll back Microsoft and OpenAI product releases if they are deemed too dangerous.\n",
      "The possibilities of AGI have led Mr. Altman to entertain the idea that some similar technology created our universe, according to billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel, a close friend of Mr. Altman's and an early donor to the nonprofit. He has long been a proponent of the idea that humans and machines will one day merge.\n",
      "ChatGPT's release triggered a stream of competing AI announcements.\n",
      "\"They've raced to release press releases,\" Mr. Altman said of his competitors. \"Obviously, they're behind now.\" Google announced it was testing its own chatbot, Bard, in February and opened access to the public in March.\n",
      "In its founding charter, OpenAI pledged to abandon its research efforts if another project came close to building AGI before it did. The goal, the company said, was to avoid a race toward building dangerous AI systems fueled by competition and instead prioritize the safety of humanity.\n",
      "OpenAI's headquarters, in San Francisco's Mission District, evoke an affluent New Age utopia more than a nonprofit trying to save the world. Stone fountains are nestled amid succulents and ferns in nearly all of the sun-soaked rooms.\n",
      "Mr. Altman gushes about the winding, central staircase he conceived so that all 400 of the company's employees would have a chance to pass each other dailyâ€”or at least on the Mondays through Wednesdays they are required to work in-person. The office includes a college-style cafeteria, a self-serve bar and a library modeled after a combination of his favorite bookstore in Paris and the Bender Room, a quiet study space on the top floor of Stanford University's largest library.\n",
      "Dressed in the typical tech CEO uniform of a gray hoodie, jeans and blindingly white sneakers, Mr. Altman described a much more modest upbringing.\n",
      "Mr. Altman grew up in a suburb of St. Louis, the eldest of four children born to Connie Gibstine, a dermatologist, and Jerry Altman, who worked various jobs, including as a lawyer, and died five years ago. The senior Mr. Altman's true vocation was running affordable housing nonprofits, his family said, and he spent years trying to revitalize St. Louis's downtown.\n",
      "Among the lessons his father taught him, Mr. Altman said, was that \"you always help peopleâ€”even if you don't think you have time, you figure it out.\"\n",
      "Dr. Gibstine said her son was working the family's VCR at age 2 and rebooking his own plane ticket home from camp at 13. By the time he was in third grade, he was helping teachers at his local public school troubleshoot computer problems, she said. In middle school, he transferred to the private John Burroughs School.\n",
      "\"Teachers liked him because he was really, really bright and a hard worker, but he was also super social,\" said Andy Abbott, the head of school, who was a principal at the time. \"He was funny and had a big personality.\"\n",
      "Mr. Altman went on to Stanford, where he did research at an AI lab. By sophomore year he had co-founded Loopt, a location-based social networking service. It became part of the first class of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator that went on to hatch companies like Airbnb Inc., Stripe Inc. and Dropbox Inc., and Mr. Altman left school.\n",
      "Loopt never got traction, selling in 2012 for $43.4 million, or close to the amount investors including Sequoia Capital put in.\n",
      "Mr. Altman then started a venture fund and made powerful allies, including Mr. Thiel and Paul Graham, who co-founded Y Combinator and eventually brought on Mr. Altman. There he helped build the company into a Silicon Valley power broker. He invested his own money in dozens of successful companies early on, including cloud software company Asana Inc. and message-board site Reddit Inc.\n",
      "While running Y Combinator, Mr. Altman began to nurse a growing fear that large research labs like DeepMind, purchased by Google in 2014, were creating potentially dangerous AI technologies outside the public eye. Mr. Musk has voiced similar concerns of a dystopian world controlled by powerful AI machines.\n",
      "Messrs. Altman and Musk decided it was time to start their own lab. Both were part of a group that pledged $1 billion to the nonprofit, OpenAI Inc.\n",
      "Mr. Musk didn't respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "The nonprofit meandered in its early years, experimenting with projects like teaching robots how to perform tasks like solving Rubik's Cubes. OpenAI laid off a chunk of its small staff in 2017.\n",
      "OpenAI researchers soon concluded that the most promising path to achieve artificial general intelligence rested in large language models, or computer programs that mimic the way humans read and write. Such models were trained on large volumes of text and required a massive amount of computing power that OpenAI wasn't equipped to fund as a nonprofit, according to Mr. Altman.\n",
      "\"We didn't have a visceral sense of just how expensive this project was going to be,\" he said. \"We still don't.\"\n",
      "That year, Mr. Altman said he looked into options to raise more money for OpenAI, such as securing federal funding and launching a new cryptocurrency. \"No one wanted to fund this in any way,\" he said. \"It was a really hard time.\"\n",
      "Tensions also grew with Mr. Musk, who became frustrated with the slow progress and pushed for more control over the organization, people familiar with the matter said.\n",
      "OpenAI executives ended up reviving an unusual idea that had been floated earlier in the company's history: creating a for-profit arm, OpenAI LP, that would report to the nonprofit parent.\n",
      "Reid Hoffman, a LinkedIn co-founder who advised OpenAI at the time and later served on the board, said the idea was to attract investors eager to make money from the commercial release of some OpenAI technology, accelerating OpenAI's progress.\n",
      "\"You want to be there first and you want to be setting the norms,\" he said. \"That's part of the reason why speed is a moral and ethical thing here.\"\n",
      "The decision further alienated Mr. Musk, the people familiar with the matter said. He parted ways with OpenAI in February 2018.\n",
      "Mr. Musk announced his departure in a company all-hands, former employees who attended the meeting said. Mr. Musk explained that he thought he had a better chance at creating artificial general intelligence through Tesla, where he had access to greater resources, they said.\n",
      "A young researcher questioned whether Mr. Musk had thought through the safety implications, the former employees said. Mr. Musk grew visibly frustrated and called the intern a \"jackass,\" leaving employees stunned, they said. It was the last time many of them would see Mr. Musk in person.\n",
      "Soon after, an OpenAI executive commissioned a \"jackass\" trophy for the young researcher, which was later presented to him on a pillow. \"You've got to have a little fun,\" Mr. Altman said. \"This is the stuff that culture gets made out of.\"\n",
      "Mr. Musk's departure marked a turning point. Later that year, OpenAI leaders told employees that Mr. Altman was set to lead the company. He formally became CEO and helped complete the creation of the for-profit subsidiary in early 2019.\n",
      "OpenAI said that it received about $130 million in contributions from the initial $1 billion pledge, but that further donations were no longer needed after the for-profit's creation. Mr. Musk has tweeted that he donated around $100 million to OpenAI.\n",
      "In the meantime, Mr. Altman began hunting for investors. His break came at Allen & Co.'s annual conference in Sun Valley, Idaho in the summer of 2018, where he bumped into Satya Nadella, the Microsoft CEO, on a stairwell and pitched him on OpenAI. Mr. Nadella said he was intrigued. The conversations picked up that winter.\n",
      "\"I remember coming back to the team after and I was like, this is the only partner,\" Mr. Altman said. \"They get the safety stuff, they get artificial general intelligence. They have the capital, they have the ability to run the compute.\"\n",
      "Mr. Altman shared the contract with employees as it was being negotiated, hosting all-hands and office hours to allay concerns that the partnership contradicted OpenAI's initial pledge to develop artificial intelligence outside the corporate world, the former employees said.\n",
      "Some employees still saw the deal as a Faustian bargain.\n",
      "OpenAI's lead safety researcher, Dario Amodei, and his lieutenants feared the deal would allow Microsoft to sell products using powerful OpenAI technology before it was put through enough safety testing, former employees said. They felt that OpenAI's technology was far from ready for a large releaseâ€”let alone with one of the world's largest software companiesâ€”worrying it could malfunction or be misused for harm in ways they couldn't predict.\n",
      "Mr. Amodei also worried the deal would tether OpenAI's ship to just one companyâ€”Microsoftâ€”making it more difficult for OpenAI to stay true to its founding charter's commitment to assist another project if it got to AGI first, the former employees said.\n",
      "Microsoft initially invested $1 billion in OpenAI. While the deal gave OpenAI its needed money, it came with a hitch: exclusivity. OpenAI agreed to only use Microsoft's giant computer servers, via its Azure cloud service, to train its AI models, and to give the tech giant the sole right to license OpenAI's technology for future products.\n",
      "\"You kind of have to jump off the cliff and hope you land,\" Mr. Nadella said in a recent interview. \"That's kind of how platform shifts happen.\"\n",
      "\"The deal completely undermines those tenets to which they secured nonprofit status,\" said Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of psychology and neural science at New York University who co-founded a machine-learning company.\n",
      "Mr. Altman \"has presided over a 180-degree pivot that seems to me to be only giving lip service to concern for humanity,\" he said.\n",
      "Mr. Altman disagreed. \"The unusual thing about Microsoft as a partner is that it let us keep all the tenets that we think are important to our mission,\" he said, including profit caps and the commitment to assist another project if it got to AGI first.\n",
      "The cash turbocharged OpenAI's progress, giving researchers access to the computing power needed to improve large language models, which were trained on billions of pages of publicly available text. OpenAI soon developed a more powerful language model called GPT-3 and then sold developers access to the technology in June 2020 through packaged lines of code known as application program interfaces, or APIs.\n",
      "Mr. Altman and Mr. Amodei clashed again over the release of the API, former employees said. Mr. Amodei wanted a more limited and staged release of the product to help reduce publicity and allow the safety team to conduct more testing on a smaller group of users, former employees said.\n",
      "Mr. Amodei left the company a few months later along with several others to found a rival AI lab called Anthropic. \"They had a different opinion about how to best get to safe AGI than we did,\" Mr. Altman said.\n",
      "Anthropic has since received more than $300 million from Google this year and released its own AI chatbot called Claude in March, which is also available to developers through an API.\n",
      "In a recent investment deck, Anthropic said it was \"committed to large-scale commercialization\" to achieve the creation of safe AGI, and that it \"fully committed\" to a commercial approach in September. The company was founded as an AI safety and research company and said at the time that it might look to create commercial value from its products.\n",
      "In the three years after the initial deal, Microsoft invested a total of $3 billion in OpenAI, according to investor documents.\n",
      "More than one million users signed up for ChatGPT within five days of its November release, a speed that surprised even Mr. Altman. It followed the company's introduction of DALL-E 2 , which can generate sophisticated images from text prompts.\n",
      "The internet blew up with anecdotes about people using ChatGPT to create sonnets or plan toddler birthday parties.\n",
      "By February, it had reached 100 million users, according to analysts at UBS, the fastest pace by a consumer app in history to reach that mark.\n",
      "Mr. Altman's close associates praise his ability to balance OpenAI's priorities. No one better navigates between the \"Scylla of misplaced idealism\" and the \"Charybdis of myopic ambition,\" Mr. Thiel said.\n",
      "Mr. Altman said he delayed the release of the latest version of its model, GPT-4, from last year to March to run additional safety tests. Users had reported some disturbing experiences with the model, integrated into Bing, where the software hallucinatedâ€”meaning it made up answers to questions it didn't know. It issued ominous warnings and made threats.\n",
      "\"The way to get it right is to have people engage with it, explore these systems, study them, to learn how to make them safe,\" Mr. Altman said.\n",
      "After Microsoft's initial investment is paid back, it would capture 49% of OpenAI's profits until the profit cap, up from 21% under prior arrangements, the documents show. OpenAI Inc., the nonprofit parent, would get the rest.\n",
      "Mr. Altman's other projects include Worldcoin, a company he co-founded that seeks to give cryptocurrency to every person on earth.\n",
      "He has put almost all his liquid wealth in recent years in two companies. He has put $375 million into Helion Energy, which is seeking to create carbon-free energy from nuclear fusion and is close to creating \"legitimate net-gain energy in a real demo,\" Mr. Altman said.\n",
      "He has also put $180 million into Retro, which aims to add 10 years to the human lifespan through \"cellular reprogramming, plasma-inspired therapeutics and autophagy,\" or the reuse of old and damaged cell parts, according to the company.\n",
      "He noted how much easier these problems are, morally, than AI. \"If you're making nuclear fusion, it's all upside. It's just good,\" he said. \"If you're making AI, it is potentially very good, potentially very terrible.\"\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTONâ€”The Biden administration detailed new criteria for an electric-vehicle tax-credit program , a change that officials said they expect will reduce the number of eligible models.\n",
      "The new rules, issued by the Treasury Department Friday, aim to make the U.S. less reliant on batteries and critical minerals shipped from China. For car buyers to claim the full $7,500 tax credit, the batteries must contain set amounts of components made in North America and critical minerals sourced in the U.S. or from certain friendly countries.\n",
      "The criteria will take effect on April 18, when a list of models that\n",
      "qualify for the tax credit will be issued. Until then, consumers can claim the full tax credit when they buy vehicles that are currently eligible, before some are expected to drop off the list.\n",
      "The program is part of the Inflation Reduction Act, a broad clean-energy, tax and healthcare law passed last year. It is designed to make electric vehicles more affordable and accelerate the shift to clean energy by updating a previous tax-credit program.\n",
      "John Bozzella, president and chief executive of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a top auto industry group, said only few of the electric-vehicle models that are currently for sale will qualify for the full $7,500 credit under the new criteria. Mr. Bozzella added that he doesn't yet know which makes and models will. Individual auto makers will report to the government in the coming days which models meet the mineral and battery-component requirements.\n",
      "Currently, 43% of electric vehicles on the market are eligible for the tax credit, down from 92% before the IRA last August required that vehicles be manufactured in North America, according to the alliance.\n",
      "\"In fact, this period may go down as the high water mark for EV tax credit eligibility since the IRA passed last year,\" Mr. Bozzella said in a blog post. More than 282,000 electric vehicles were sold in the U.S. in the October-December quarter last year, up 51% from a year earlier and making up 8.5% of all vehicle sales, the group said.\n",
      "Steven Schmoll, a director at KPMG, said anyone in the market for an electric vehicle should consider whether the critical mineral and battery component requirements would apply: \"There could be a $7,500 difference between taking possession of an EV on April 17 versus April 18.\"\n",
      "Writing the new rules has been a headache for the Biden administration, under pressure from trading partners that said the legislation would harm their auto makers . Some allies said they are still negotiating with U.S. officials to make sure they are covered by a key aspect of the rules.\n",
      "While companies have increased assembly of electric vehicles and batteries in the U.S., China dominates the global critical-minerals supply .\n",
      "\"Put simply, we want to end this overreliance,\" an administration official said. \"And we now have tools in our tool belt.\"\n",
      "Part of the Inflation Reduction Act's electric-vehicle tax-credit program went into effect on Jan. 1 , without the critical-mineral and battery-component rules. Until mid-April, all electric vehicles assembled in North America and priced below certain levelsâ€”$80,000 for sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks, and $55,000 for other vehiclesâ€”will be eligible for the full $7,500 credit. Currently, over 20 models qualify.\n",
      "When the new rules kick in, a vehicle will need to meet the critical-mineral rule to be eligible for $3,750 of the tax credit. That requires at least 40% of battery minerals, based on value, to be extracted or processed in the U.S. or countries that have free-trade agreements with the U.S., or recycled in North America. That ratio will rise to 80% by 2027.\n",
      "To qualify for the rest of credit, vehicles will have to meet the battery-component criteriaâ€”at least 50% manufactured or assembled in North America, climbing to 100% by 2029. The guidance released Friday spells out how companies should calculate these percentages.\n",
      "The program has income caps of $300,000 for married couples, $225,000 for heads of households and $150,000 for others. Friday's rules make clear that corporations and other entities that don't report adjusted gross income are eligible for the credit, though many may prefer to use a credit for commercial vehicles that has fewer restrictions.\n",
      "A separate program for commercial vehicles offers tax incentives without local-assembly or battery-sourcing requirements, making a wider range of vehicles eligible for the benefit if they are bought by businesses for leasing or rental.\n",
      "Administration officials expect the number of vehicles for which consumers can claim the full tax credit to decline temporarily with the introduction of the new criteria. In the long term, they say new domestic vehicle and battery plants being built by U.S. and foreign companies will mean more cars will be eligible. Since the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act, companies have announced plans to build 75 facilities with a total investment of more than $45 billion, administration officials say.\n",
      "The new proposed rules were rolled out three months after the original target date, as administration officials tried to address concerns raised by trading partners and lawmakers. Although the guidance takes effect next month, it isn't final and will go through a 60-day public-comment period.\n",
      "Some lawmakers say the Treasury Department has interpreted the law too broadly. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), the author of the EV program, criticized the administration's reading of the law in the new rules, saying it allowed for more participation of foreign companies than intended.\n",
      "\"It is horrific that the administration continues to ignore the purpose of the law, which is to bring manufacturing back to America and ensure we have reliable and secure supply chains,\" he said. \"American tax dollars should not be used to support manufacturing jobs overseas.\"\n",
      "The EV rule also has prompted spats with allies, including the European Union, South Korea, Japan and the U.K., which said the local-assembly and battery-sourcing requirements discriminate against their companies. Complaining that the U.S. subsidy program will redirect business investments from Europe to North America, the EU recently beefed up its own clean-energy subsidies .\n",
      "The Treasury Department listed more than 20 countries, including Australia, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, as free-trade agreement countries that qualify under the critical-minerals rule. While a recent announcement to forge a bilateral critical-minerals agreement added Japan to the list, the EU and the U.K. remain ineligible.\n",
      "\"We're quite optimistic that we can reach an agreement of the same sort of substantial scope as the Japanese,\" Margrethe Vestager, the EU's executive vice president and commissioner for competition, said Thursday. Ms. Vestager met Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in Washington Friday.\n",
      "The deal with Japan has drawn pushback from some lawmakers. House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R., Mo.) said the administration was negotiating \"fake trade agreements in secret without approval by Congress.\"\n",
      "The administration will later issue guidance on another key aspect of the electric-vehicle program: a rule on \"foreign entities of concern,\" which will make vehicles ineligible for the tax credits starting next year if their batteries contain any components or critical minerals sourced from an entity linked to China or other adversaries.\n",
      "This is seen as an especially high hurdle for auto makers, as numerous joint-venture operations between companies from China and companies from the U.S. and friendly nations currently play significant roles in EV-battery supply chains.\n",

      "Full text: Wall Street projected an oil bonanza this year. The first quarter upended those expectations.\n",
      "Russia has continued pumping out petroleum despite Western sanctions . The U.S. market has remained awash in crude after the conclusion of the Biden administration's emergency release of oil reserves . And a Chinese rebound that underpinned some analysts' predictions of a commodity boom has yet to juice global demand.\n",
      "Instead, the oil producers and traders that captured monster profits in 2022 are now weighing whether a slowdown in the U.S. and Europe is coming sooner rather than laterâ€”if it comes at all. The tremors at Western bank s in March magnified that uncertainty , leaving investors wading through complicated crosscurrents running from financial markets to the real world.\n",
      "The banking stress led to oil's steepest weekly selloff since the beginning of the pandemic and took some of the sheen off energy stocks, one of the market's major winners in 2022. The S&P 500 energy sector slid 5.6% in the first quarter, according to FactSet, a decline outpaced only by financial stocks.\n",
      "Some investors now fear that crude's China-driven rally could be slowed by an unpredictable outlook for U.S. and European industries heavily reliant on gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.\n",
      "Khendry Veras, a vice president at On Time Logistics, a family-owned trucking company in Newark, N.J., said falling fuel costs in recent months haven't made up for dwindling shipping-container deliveries for its fleet of 40 semitrailers that haul freight up and down the East Coast.\n",
      "\"We're doing our best to hold on,\" Mr. Veras said.\n",
      "During a year in which many on Wall Street projected the value of oil to jump, allowing the energy industry to shower shareholders with more cash, the outlook of oil-and-gas executives has turned negative, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey of 147 companies. Benchmark U.S. prices, meanwhile, have slipped 5.7%.\n",
      "\"The price moves that we've seen have played out because, to a good extent, the elements that were expected to be bullish have turned out to be bearish,\" said Matt Smith, an analyst at the ship-tracking firm Kpler.\n",
      "For now, many physical trading houses and hedge funds that speculate on oil continue to see upside in China, parsing shipping routes, traffic patterns and air-travel numbers for hints that its postpandemic recovery is gaining steam.\n",
      "The country imported nearly 11.4 million barrels of seaborne oil a day in March, according to Kpler, the second-highest monthly total the firm has recorded. A hiring spree of skyscraper-size supertankers in the coming weeks suggests the uptick could continue.\n",
      "\"It's picking up,\" said Cyril Ducau, chief executive of Singapore-based Eastern Pacific Shipping, which commands a 225-vessel fleet, pointing to growing imports of oil, refined fuel and iron ore.\n",
      "Many investors remain optimistic China will help the broader energy sector continue to pass out dividends and stock buybacks throughout 2023.\n",
      "\"You look at the second half of the year, and global oil demand is reaching all-time highs,\" said Rob Thummel, managing director at Tortoise, an energy-investment firm.\n",
      "For some traders, the big question is whether China's appetite for oil will growâ€”boosting pricesâ€”before the U.S. and European hunger for energy subsides.\n",
      "In the U.S., the overall economy continues to chug along. Fears of broader contagion from the banking stress have receded, and stock markets have rebounded. The Federal Reserve at its meeting in March continued to raise interest rates to cool inflation.\n",
      "But petroleum analysts see at least one warning sign for energy markets. Demand for diesel has dropped nearly 12% from a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration, contributing to unusual growth in U.S. oil stockpiles for much of 2023.\n",
      "That slip in demand has come as some diesel-reliant industries have seen a drop in borrowing and business activity. Companies in construction, agriculture, and metals and mining last year sold less than half the bonds they did in 2021, according to PitchBook LCD, suggesting that financing for new projects is tightening. The manufacturing sector in February reported its sixth straight month of declining orders for products such as carpeting, furniture and appliances.\n",
      "Rising rates have slammed mortgage lending and forced home-building companies to pull back from single-family-home jobs, idling work vehicles and diesel-driven equipment including excavators.\n",
      "\"The single-family housing segment is in its own recession,\" said Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, a construction-industry trade group.\n",
      "Imports from container ships tumbled in recent months as retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corp., Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. pulled back on orders . In Newark, On Time Logistics has responded by cutting employees' hours and bracing for furloughs or layoffs if things don't improve.\n",
      "Mr. Veras said the company spent as much as $40,000 a week fueling up on diesel last summer, when there was a steady need for trucks to carry containers of nails, marble and other freight. Diesel's cost per gallon has slid since then, but the number of trips made by On Time Logisticsâ€”and the amount of diesel its vehicles useâ€”has dropped even faster.\n",
      "Now, Mr. Veras said, the company's weekly fuel costs have plunged to $10,000 or $15,000. But he is optimistic business will pick back up heading into summer.\n",
      "\"It has got to get better from here on out,\" he said.\n",

      "\n",
      "Full text: Core inflation in the eurozone hit a record in March, a setback for central bankers whose rapid interest-rate rises have exacerbated financial sector strains and caused pains in part of the bloc's economy.\n",
      "The fresh data increases the likelihood that the European Central Bank will raise its key rate again in May. It could also encourage governments to explore alternative ways to cool prices rises by targeting inflationary increases in profits.\n",
      "The European Union's statistics agency said consumer prices in the eurozone were 6.9% higher in March than a year earlier, a decline from the 8.5% rate of inflation recorded in February and the lowest in just over a year. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal last week had expected to see a decline to 7.1%.\n",
      "The sharp fall in the annual inflation rate was driven by energy prices, which surged in March last year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but have since fallen back.\n",
      "The core rate of inflation however, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose to 5.7% from 5.6%, reaching the highest level since records began in 2001. Central bankers tend to focus on core inflation as an indication of whether rate rises are cooling inflation since it better reflects the balance of demand and supply in the economy.\n",
      "\"This reinforces our view that the ECB will keep hiking in the coming months despite some financial stability concerns,\" economists at HSBC said.\n",
      "As they consider their next steps, policy makers will be aware that further rate rises risk deepening strains in the European banking system. These strains could amplify the impact of interest-rate rises by leading to a sharper decline in lending to businesses and households than the ECB had anticipated.\n",
      "This added stress in the banking system came into sharp relief when Credit Suisse Group AG, weakened by years of scandals and trading losses, came under intense market pressure, prompting Swiss regulators to engineer UBS Group AG's takeover of its rival . That followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the U.S., which brought the challenges of adjusting to a sharp rise in interest rates into focus.\n",
      "Policy makers have long been concerned that the surge in energy and food prices after the invasion of Ukraine would lead to an increase in pay rises, in turn prompting businesses to raise their prices and setting off a fresh round of pay demands.\n",
      "Some ECB rate setters are now also looking at the inflationary potential of widening profit margins, with one official warning of a \"profit-price spiral.\"\n",
      "\"Opportunistic behavior by firms could also delay the fall in core inflation,\" said Fabio Panetta last week.\n",
      "ECB President Christine Lagarde has echoed that concern, saying that a refusal on the part of business ownersâ€”not just workersâ€”to accept a decline in their real incomes could entrench high inflation.\n",
      "Since the eurozone imports most of its energy, the sharp rise in energy prices since the months leading up to the invasion of Ukraine is a transfer of resources out of the currency area and to energy suppliers such as Norway, the U.S. and Qatar.\n",
      "In 2022, the European Union's energy imports cost 833.7 billion eurosâ€”equivalent to around $909 billionâ€”more than double the â‚¬390.3 billion bill for 2021, despite a decline in energy consumption.\n",
      "Eurozone policy makers often compare that loss of resources to a tax rise, and Ms. Lagarde said a sharing of that burden between workers and business owners would help contain inflation.\n",
      "\"It is certainly something that we would welcome, to the extent that it reduces the risk of second-round effects in particular,\" she said earlier this month.\n",
      "Eurozone wages rose at an annual pace of 5.1% during the last quarter of 2022, the fastest rise since records began in 1996, with the exception of the second quarter of 2021, which was boosted by one-off pandemic-related effects.\n",
      "Encouraged by an unemployment rate that fell back to a record low of 6.6% in February, some workers seeking larger pay rises have resorted to strikes. In one of Germany's biggest walkouts in decades, a large-scale transport strike brought large parts of the country to a standstill on Monday as two labor unions sought raises of 10.5% and 12% respectively.\n",
      "Data through the end of 2022 show profits have been rising faster than wages over recent years. And according to the ECB, profits accounted for a larger share of the rise in prices of goods and services than did wages during the final six months of last year. Sectors where the growth in profits has outstripped the growth in wages include manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, accommodation and food services.\n",
      "\"It looks to me as if this inflation shock has encouraged some of these companies to beef up their margins,\" said Claus Vistesen, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n",
      "Some business owners have said that price rises that exceed cost increases allow companies to keep prices stable, instead of burdening customers with recurrent price increases that closely track inflation.\n",
      "Central bankers don't have any direct way to cool rising profits other than through higher interest rates that weaken demand. Governments can use taxes to cap profit increases more directly.\n",
      "Economists have long pointed to a lack of competition in many of the eurozone's services industries as a drag on growth, but this may now be enabling businesses to claim wider profit margins.\n",
      "\"If there is not enough competition, it's time for regulators to take stock and do something about it,\" said Alvaro Pereira, chief economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n",
      "However, regulatory changes can take time to have an impact and ECB policy makers don't appear to be prepared to wait.\n",
      "\"Margin compression will have to happen, playing an important role in the disinflation process,\" said Marco Valli, global head of research at Italy's UniCredit. \"The longer it takes to get there, the higher the risk that the ECB would need to tighten aggressively, pushing the eurozone into the nasty-recession scenario.\"\n",

      "Full text: After years of uncertainty, last year's Inflation Reduction Act finally gave America's renewable-energy industry a long, green signal. Now the economy is blocking the road.\n",
      "The wind and solar industries have always suffered from the short-term nature of subsidies, with federal tax credits often extended in nail-biting one-year increments. Last year's climate bill changed that, giving the industry subsidies that last at least a decade. But just as policy winds blow in their favor, two critical growth driversâ€”interest rates and equipment costsâ€”are moving in the wrong direction.\n",
      "Wind and solar projects are especially sensitive to rates because debt can comprise as much as 85% to 90% of capital expenditures. Renewable developers have known only low rates for most of their history. Nearly all U.S. utility-scale solar facilities and 85% of onshore wind farms were installed since 2009, during which period the target federal-funds rate was close to 0% in eight out of 13 years. Not any more: After the most recent hike , rates are the highest since 2007.\n",
      "Renewable energy projects tend to be financed with floating-rate loans that rise and fall with the benchmark interest rate. Thankfully, most of those projects are well-shielded from rate risk because lenders require them to hedge at least 75% of their loans through swaps, according to Elizabeth Waters, managing director of project finance at MUFG. Most ended up hedging 90-95% to lock in low rates, she noted. But those swaps won't help new projects. Some new solar and wind projects facing higher borrowing costs than when they were planned might not make it off the drawing board.\n",
      "Borrowing isn't the only thing that costs more. Following years of price declines thanks to technology and economies of scale, equipment is getting more expensive too. Trade policies aimed at Chinese manufacturers have caused delays and shortages for the solar industry, which relies heavily on the country for its components. German utility RWE, an active developer in the U.S., said in its annual report released last week that imports of solar modules from Asia are now subject to \"stringent checks\" and said it could fall behind on its expansion plans if the U.S. continues to \"impede the procurement of solar panels.\"\n",
      "After falling to a record low in 2020, the average price of a solar photovoltaic system rose in 2021 and then again in 2022, according to data from the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie. Meanwhile, the average cost to build an onshore wind farm in the U.S. rose in 2020 and 2021 before leveling off last year, according to data from BloombergNEF. Supply-chain issues and interconnection delays already started slowing the clean power industry last year: In 2022 it installed 25.1 Gigawatts of total capacity, a 16% decline from a year earlier, according to the American Clean Power Association, which tracks solar, wind and energy storage. While that's still enough to meet roughly half of Texas' electricity demand, it was nonetheless below expectationsâ€“though part of the drop was driven by an preplanned phase-down for tax credits commonly used by the wind industry before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed.\n",
      "Ultimately, solar and wind's ability to absorb cost and interest-rate hikes depends on how willing utilities and corporations are to pay higher prices. Many onshore wind and solar projects have been able to renegotiate pricing on their power purchase agreements because demand is robust, according to industry executives. But cracks are showing for offshore wind, which is more exposed to rising costs and rates because it takes longer to develop. BloombergNEF estimates that the weighted average cost of capital for U.S. offshore wind projects rose to 5.25% in 2022 from 4.41% in 2020.\n",
      "Developer Avangrid Renewables, for example, is trying to terminate its power purchase agreement with utilities in Massachusetts for a 1.2 Gigawatt offshore wind project after an unsuccessful attempt at renegotiating its fixed-price contract. If built, Commonwealth Wind would generate enough energy to power 700,000 homes. The company cited \"historic price increases for global commodities, sharp and sudden increases in interest rates, prolonged supply chain constraints, and persistent inflation\" since the project secured a contract in late 2021. Avangrid plans to bid the same project into the state's next competitive offshore wind procurement, a spokesman said over email. Danish power company Orsted said in its annual report released February that it incurred an impairment of 2.5 billion Danish kroner, the equivalent of $369 million, on its 50% interest in the Sunrise Wind project off the coast of New York, noting that the project cost has increased substantially since its bid in 2019.\n",
      "As the name implies, the Inflation Reduction Act is supposed to relieve some of these cost pressures. But it won't feel like a bonanza without clarity on how the rules apply. Expanding the eligibility of tax credits to more technologies, for example, has spread the limited pool of tax equity investorsâ€”that is, those with both the tax burden and the know-how to use renewable tax creditsâ€”more thinly across more projects. Ironically, that has shrunk the pool of tax equity available to solar and wind in the near term. The bill tries to address this by making such tax credits transferable, but industry executives said that pool of capital will remain constrained until there is more guidance.\n",
      "A solar site in Lumpkin, Ga. PHOTO: Audra Melton for The Wall Street Journal\n",
      "There are two other more recent developments worth watching: One is the plummeting cost of natural gas which, if prolonged, could impact demand for solar and wind on the margins. The U.S. benchmark Henry Hub has fallen 49% year to date. Secondly, banks' recent turmoil could shrink their ability to lend. Ted Brandt, chief executive of clean-energy focused investment bank Marathon Capital, notes that the industry has always had cheap debt, cheap equity and \"massive liquidity chasing it.\" How the industry will respond to expensive capital is still an open question, he said.\n",
      "It isn't enough for policy winds to blow in the right direction for a renewable energy boomâ€“economic headwinds need to abate too.\n",

      "Full text: Consumer spending rose more modestly in February after a sharp jump at the start of the year, while inflation cooled but remained elevated.\n",
      "Households boosted their spending by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in February from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Friday. That followed a revised 2% increase in January, but economists said the two months viewed together represented a solid gain as 2023 got under way.\n",
      "\"February's consumer spending numbers should be viewed as quite strong,\" said Pooja Sriram, U.S. economist at Barclays. \"Households continue to feel the tailwind from strong gains in wages and salaries, fueled by strong labor demand, and continue to dip into excess savings accumulated during the pandemic for additional firepower.\"\n",
      "Inflation continued to take a bite out of spending power, however. When adjusted for rising prices, household spending fell 0.1% in February from the prior month, after rising a revised 1.5% in January.\n",
      "The February figures don't reflect any impact on consumer spending from banking industry turmoil , which emerged in March.\n",
      "Inflation eased in February, though it remains significantly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The personal consumption-expenditures price index climbed 5% in February from a year earlier, down from 5.3% in January.\n",
      "The core-PCE price indexâ€”which omits volatile food and energy pricesâ€”rose 4.6% in February from a year earlier, compared with 4.7% the prior month. The Fed sees the core measure as a better predictor of future inflation.\n",
      "U.S. stocks rose on Friday after the softer inflation and spending figures.\n",
      "The Fed raised short-term interest rates by a quarter-percentage point on March 22, its ninth straight increase aimed at curbing inflation by slowing the economy. It lifted its benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 4.75% and 5%, the highest level since September 2007.\n",
      "Though inflation remains high, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the central bank could stop raising interest rates sooner than previously thought if the recent banking system stress triggers a pullback in lending.\n",
      "In the weeks before the banking crisis, the economy showed surprising strength despite the Fed's rate increases. Employers added a seasonally adjusted 311,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate was 3.6%, near historic lows, the Labor Department said. Home sales rose in February from the prior month for the first time in a year.\n",
      "Early signs indicate that the economy stayed on a solid track in March. S urveys showed that U.S. business activity picked up along with consumer confidence in the economic outlook. Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, are hovering near historically low levels .\n",
      "But banking tumultâ€”and tighter lending that might resultâ€”will influence business investments more directly than consumer spending, said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n",
      "With consumer spending accounting for around two-thirds of output, a strong labor market translates to a resilient economy, economists said.\n",
      "\"Even though we're seeing layoffs in tech, with unemployment at 3.6%, what you have is that people who want jobs can get jobs,\" said Leo Feler, chief economist at Numerator, a consumer insights and data company. \"That means households have income and spending power.\"\n",
      "Consumers' spending accounts for around two-thirds of U.S. economic output, making it the key to growth.\n",
      "Their spending on goods rose 3.7% in February from December, lifted by increased outlays on furniture, electronics and pleasure boats. Spending on services picked up 1.5% in the same period, as consumers shelled out more on air travel and at movie theaters, restaurants and amusement parks.\n",
      "Household finances also got a boost in February, the Commerce report showed. Income rose 0.3% in February from the prior month, pushed up by increasing wages for service sector workers in particular, said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n",
      "And the personal saving rate was 4.6% in February, the highest in more than a year.\n",
      "Chandler Atkins, owner of Elms Waterfront Cottages in Lake Luzerne, N.Y., said bookings are as strong as last year with people visiting from across the country. When the economy turns down, New Yorkers tend to dominate bookings as they dial back more ambitious travel plans, he said. But when times are good, those from farther afield pick up.\n",
      "\"I just took a couple bookings yesterday from people in California,\" he said. \"They must feel that the economy is strong enough and they're not facing recession stress right now. Inflation is coming down right now, even though it's happening slowly. It's causing people to feel like things are getting better, not worse, I think.\"\n",
      "Mr. Atkins is expanding his business, launching a new lodging and events venue and an all-terrain vehicle track on Memorial Day. He is keeping an eye on banking industry troubles but isn't overly concerned. \"I don't think that's really going to have an impact on the vacationer this year,\" he said.\n",
      "Solid consumer demand is putting price pressure on services, as consumers shell out on sporting events, concerts, packaged tours, restaurants and other recreation, said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors Inc.\n",
      "\"The price increases for some of these recreation services are just astronomical,\" he said. \"People are slowing their spending overall but basically, companies are able to pass on some more price increases because people are willing to pay.\"\n",
      "Still, higher prices are driving some consumers to seek to cut costsâ€”sometimes in dramatic ways.\n",
      "John Johnson, a 39-year-old mechanical engineer, is fleeing the Washington, D.C. suburbs for Pittsburgh in May in search of a lower cost of living. He and his wife, Elizabeth, had settled in Takoma Park, Md., eight years ago due to its proximity to public transit. But her job is now fully remote, and the neighborhood is relatively pricey.\n",
      "\"Last night we went out and paid $8 for a beerâ€”you can buy a decent bottle of wine for something like that. And even though inflation is 6%, restaurants are 20% or 30% more expensive,\" he said. \"We've both had pay increases over the past three or four years, but those gains have evened out or even gone negative.\"\n",
      "The couple made plans to renovate their kitchen due to spending more time cooking at home since the pandemic. But they struggled to find contractors and, when they did, couldn't afford the high prices. That is when Mr. Johnson started looking for a job elsewhere.\n",
      "\"The house we're getting in Pittsburgh is pretty much three times bigger than our current house, and only 25% more expensive,\" he said.\n",

      "Full text: Markets showed their resilience in the first quarter, despite being rocked by shock waves that few anticipated .\n",
      "Investors began the year feeling largely upbeat. Inflation appeared to be subsiding, and many bet that would lead the Federal Reserve to switch quickly from raising interest rates to cutting them.\n",
      "Then economic data started coming in hot. Stocks and bond prices slid, hit by worries that the Fed would likely have to keep rates higher for longer.\n",
      "The biggest shock of the quarter came in March, when Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. Bank stocks tumbled. Credit Suisse Group AG came to the brink of failure, forcing rival bank UBS Group AG to arrange a hasty takeover. The biggest U.S. banks scrambled to shore up First Republic Bank to stop growing panic from taking down more lenders.\n",
      "In the face of significant uncertainty, markets proved to be more buoyant than many investors thought possible.\n",
      "The S&P 500 rose 7% in the first quarter, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite soared. The technology-heavy index jumped 17%, outperforming the Dow industrials by the widest margin since 2001. Overall, it was Nasdaq's best quarter since the second quarter of 2020.\n",
      "Meanwhile, bond prices climbed . The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which influences everything from mortgage rates to student loans, fell to 3.491% from 3.826% at the end of 2022. That marks its biggest quarterly decline 2020.\n",
      "What explains the relative calm in markets?\n",
      "\"Things have been better than many feared,\" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Asset Management.\n",
      "A widely anticipated recession has failed to materialize, at least so far. The labor market has remained robust, even with a pickup in layoffs in the technology sector in recent months. And inflation, while still high, has continued to ease. Data showed consumer prices rose 6% from a year earlier in February, the smallest annual gain since September 2021.\n",
      "The combination of factors has helped investors including Mr. Freedman to stay somewhat optimisticâ€”although he is still advising clients to stick to higher-quality companies within credit markets.\n",
      "\"We don't think we are out of the woods yet,\" Mr. Freedman said.\n",
      "Some investors and analysts, for instance, are wary of the risk that markets will be proved wrong about where the Fed will take interest rates the rest of the year.\n",
      "Recent projections show Fed officials expect the federal-funds rate to rise to at least 5.1% from its current range of 4.75% to 5%. That suggests the Fed could push through one more quarter-point interest-rate increase and then hold rates at that level for the remainder of the year.\n",
      "Yet Wall Street has once again grown more confident that the Fed will begin cutting rates as soon as the second half. Derivatives markets show traders expect the federal-funds rate to peak at around 4.9% in May, then fall to about 4.4% by the end of the year, according to FactSet.\n",
      "\"There's a disconnect between market expectations for the Fed and what the Fed is saying,\" said Michelle Cluver, portfolio strategist at Global X ETFs, who attributed the bets on rate cuts in part to the fallout from the banking crisis in March.\n",
      "Heightened expectations for rate cuts have driven investors into many of the stocks that were among the worst hit in last year's market selloff. Nvidia Corp. soared 90% in the first quarter, while Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. rose 76% and Tesla Inc. climbed 68%.\n",
      "Bitcoin also jumped. The cryptocurrency traded above $28,000 on Friday, up around 71% for the quarter.\n",
      "Meanwhile, many of last year's biggest winners have lagged behind. Energy stocks , which soared in 2022, fell in the first quarter. So did crude oil prices.\n",
      "Analysts and investors are divided on how long that reversion will last.\n",
      "\"I do believe there may need to be repricing from markets on where rates are going to be,\" Ms. Cluver said. At the moment, with the crisis in the banking sector looking relatively contained, there doesn't seem to be a strong reason for the Fed to cut rates in the near future, she added.\n",
      "For some, the biggest question remains how well the economy will hold up under the strain of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions .\n",
      "\"I don't think anyone can really answer with certainty if we're entirely through a challenging period,\" said Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco.\n",
      "So far, the economy has held up better than many had expected. If there is a recession within the year, it seems likely it would be relatively mild, Mr. Levitt said. \"The challenge is seeing if there's something lurking that makes it more severe,\" he said.\n",

      "Full text: Coal prices have come crashing down from last year's records.\n",
      "Central Appalachian coal has been trading at $88.80 a short ton, down 57% from the record $205.55 at the start of the year.\n",
      "Cash prices for thermal coal mined from northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin -- two places where a lot of exported coal originates -- have fallen more than half since September, when Europe was stocking up for winter. Futures for coal that is shipped around the Pacific from an Australian export facility have made a similar plunge.\n",
      "Coal markets are highly influenced by those for natural gas, which is also burned to generate electricity. As with coal, natural-gas inventories that looked alarmingly low last summer recovered thanks to unusually warm winter weather that obviated a lot of demand for heating.\n",
      "Natural-gas futures for May delivery ended Thursday at $2.104 per million British thermal unit, down 63% from a year ago.\n",
      "Even after the decline in coal prices, varieties produced in the Eastern U.S. have lately cost between $3.10 to $3.55 per million BTUs, according to the Energy Information Administration. That suggests that coal prices might have to fall further to regain competitiveness with natural gas.\n",
      "Coal also faces increased competition from renewables, including wind, solar, hydropower and biomass, which last year accounted for more U.S. power generation than coal for the first time ever, federal record keepers say.\n",
      "Coal remains expensive relative to prepandemic prices, but its rapid deflation shows that power producers around the world are confident enough in their supplies to stop bidding up cargoes.\n",
      "\"We went from undersupplied to oversupplied very quickly,\" said Andy Blumenfeld, data analytics director at McCloskey by OPIS, a pricing service that is part of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co.\n",
      "Prices started surging in 2021, when producers fired up coal-burning generators to keep air conditioners running during some of the hottest temperatures on record. Stockpiles at U.S. power plants shrank to their lowest since the Nixon administration.\n",
      "A ban on Russian exports following the invasion of Ukraine further crimped supplies, while the highest natural-gas prices in years and the prospect of shortages pushed up what power generators were willing to pay for coal.\n",
      "By the summer of 2022 -- another scorcher -- power producers on both sides of the Atlantic were competing for a limited supply of unsold coal. North American power generators' stockpiles dwindled to as little as 58 days' worth of coal, nearly a month less than the five-year average, according to energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.\n",
      "Congestion at ports and along rail lines ensnared cargoes, prompting grid operators and utilities to take unusual steps to curtail coal use before the weather turned cold. In Colorado, Xcel Energy Inc.'s state subsidiary dialed back how much coal it burned in favor of natural gas, even as the competing fuel's price spiked to shale-era highs.\n",
      "\"Given the fact that we were seeing delays and shortages in the delivery of coal, we made the prudent call that we would use less coal so that we could conserve that in advance of the winter heating season,\" said Robert Kenney, president of Xcel Energy's Colorado arm.\n",
      "Warm winter weather left a lot of coal unburned, though. Between December and January U.S. inventories grew by 4.6% at a time of year when they typically decline, according to EIA data.\n",
      "As they raced to stock up, utilities ordered all the coal they could, much of which is scheduled to be delivered this year and could create a glut, analysts say.\n",
      "For decades coal was the primary fuel burned to generate electricity in the U.S. Since 2010, though, U.S. coal-fired generating capacity has dropped more than 36% amid concerns about emissions and the abundance of gas unleashed by the shale-drilling boom, according to FactSet. Power plant owners are expected to retire an additional 4.5% of coal-fired capacity this year, according to the EIA.\n",
      "As coal-burning capacity has dwindled, so has financing for speculative production. Miners now sell most of their output in advance, with not much more to sell if demand is greater than expected.\n",
      "Big mining companies have told investors that they are mostly sold out for 2023. It is possible that power producers have overbought and will try to resell their coal in export markets or renegotiate deals with their suppliers, which could add downward pressure to prices, McCloskey's Mr. Blumenfeld said.\n",
      "Already, he said, some utilities are burning coal to make space for incoming deliveries even though it has become uneconomical.\n",

      "The two countries, already on opposite sides of a war in Ukraine, have also clashed over the arrests of each other's citizens and the state of nuclear-arms treaties.\n",
      "President Biden was briefed on the detention of Mr. Gershkovich, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. She reiterated earlier State Department warnings that Americans are urged to avoid traveling to Russia.\n",
      "\"We've been very clear about Americans not going to Russia. It is not safe,\" Ms. Jean-Pierre said.\n",
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. seeks immediate consular access to Mr. Gershkovich so it can provide the appropriate support.\n",
      "\"In the strongest possible terms, we condemn the Kremlin's continued attempts to intimidate, repress, and punish journalists and civil society voices,\" Mr. Blinken said.\n",
      "Russia's main security agency on Thursday said it had detained Mr. Gershkovich in the city of Yekaterinburg, around 800 miles east of Moscow, on Wednesday while he was on a reporting trip, accusing him of espionage.\n",
      "\"The Wall Street Journal vehemently denies the allegations from the FSB and seeks the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter, Evan Gershkovich,\" the Journal said. \"We stand in solidarity with Evan and his family.\"\n",
      "National Security Council Strategic Coordinator John Kirby said it wasn't immediately clear if Mr. Gershkovich's detention was coordinated with Russian leadership, or aimed as retaliation for other grievances. Last week, Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov, 37, a Russian national, was charged in a U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., with acting as an agent of a foreign power, visa fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud and other charges stemming from his alleged illegal activities in the U.S., according to the Justice Department.\n",
      "Russia's Federal Security Bureau said Mr. Gershkovich, \"acting on the instructions of the American side, collected information constituting a state secret about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex.\" Mr. Gershkovich is accredited to work as a journalist in Russia by the country's Foreign Ministry.\n",
      "Authorities took Mr. Gershkovich to Moscow, where he appeared in court with a state-appointed defense attorney and was ordered held in custody until May 29, said the press service of the court, according to state news agency TASS.\n",
      "In Russia, espionage trials are often conducted in secret and it is rare for a court to acquit a defendant. Trials can take months to unfold.\n",
      "\"It's a new low in the U.S.-Russia relationship,\" said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. The arrest of an accredited American reporter \"is really setting a precedent.\"\n",
      "Former Vice President Mike Pence called on the Biden administration to expel Russian diplomats from the U.S.\n",
      "\"It's time for the Biden administration to make it clear with Putin that we're not going to put up with his provocations, we're not going to put up with bullying reporters,\" said Mr. Pence on CNN Thursday. Mr. Pence is considering running for the GOP presidential nomination in 2024.\n",
      "In December, the U.S. released convicted Russian arms-trafficker Viktor Bout in an exchange for U.S. women's basketball star Brittney Griner, whom Russian authorities had detained in the days before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. She was found to be carrying hashish oil in her luggage and was later convicted of drug smuggling and possession. Ms. Griner was sentenced to nine years in a penal colony.\n",
      "The White House and the Kremlin remain entangled over Russia's detention since 2018 of former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan on espionage charges.\n",
      "Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, asked about the chance of an exchange for Mr. Gershkovich, said it was premature to discuss the issue.\n",
      "\"I would not even raise the question right now\" because past exchanges involved people already serving sentences, Mr. Ryabkov was quoted by state newswire RIA Novosti as saying on Thursday. \"We'll see how this story develops further.\"\n",
      "Mr. Gershkovich's detention sparked a diplomatic outcry from countries that viewed Russia's actions as unacceptable and a reflection of Russia's systemic indifference to media freedom.\n",
      "Dame Karen Pierce, the British ambassador to Washington, said the incident reflects Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"total disregard for basic freedoms.\" Josep Borrell Fontelles, the high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy, said that \"journalists must be allowed to exercise their profession freely and deserve protection.\"\n",
      "Mr. Gershkovich dropped out of contact with his editors while working in Yekaterinburg on Wednesday afternoon.\n",
      "A post later appeared on Telegram describing a man with his face hidden being bundled from a restaurant in the city and put into a waiting van. It couldn't be determined whether the person was Mr. Gershkovich.\n",
      "A lawyer hired by the Journal attempted to find Mr. Gershkovich at the FSB building in Yekaterinburg, but was told authorities had no information about him.\n",
      "Mr. Gershkovich subsequently surfaced in Moscow, where he was represented by a court-appointed lawyer.\n",
      "TASS, which cited unnamed sources, reported that Mr. Gershkovich pleaded not guilty at the closed hearing. His case, according to TASS, is considered top secret.\n",
      "Mr. Gershkovich joined the Journal in January 2022. He has worked as a reporter in Russia since 2017, first for the Moscow Times and then for Agence France-Presse. Earlier, he was a news assistant in New York for the New York Times. A graduate of Bowdoin College, he most recently wrote about the impact of Western sanctions on Russia's economy.\n",
      "Friends and colleagues know him as an enterprising journalist who tackled his new role with energy and courage at a time when covering Mr. Putin's Russia grew more difficult amid a contracting space for freedom of expression and media.\n",
      "\"It was becoming such a frustrating job, and here comes Evan, so full of energy,\" said Nataliya Vasilyeva, a correspondent for Britain's Telegraph who knew Mr. Gershkovich in Moscow. \"It was so amazing to watch him, who didn't have this baggage.\"\n",
      "Mr. Gershkovich was born to a father from Odessa and a mother from St. Petersburg, both Jewish immigrants who settled in the U.S. after leaving the Soviet Union. He mastered the Russian language as an adult living in Moscow, according to friends and colleagues. His understanding of the language and affinity for the Russian people gave him an advantage as a journalist, colleagues said.\n",
      "\"He knew he was American but he also felt very much at home. He traveled around Russia, he felt he was a Moscovite,\" said Ms. Vasilyeva.\n",
      "Reporting in Russia has become much more difficult since Mr. Putin in February last year launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine and then cracked down on domestic dissent.\n",
      "Russia last March passed a censorship law that makes it illegal to publish what authorities deem false information about military operations in Ukraine. In response, many domestic news outlets ceased operations or left the country, and foreign media significantly restricted reporting inside Russia and withdrew many staff.\n",
      "Mr. Putin in October tightened restrictions across Russian society with a presidential decree granting local governments in the country's regions new authority to address security concerns. The measures were aimed at maintaining public order, boosting industrial production in support of the military campaign and protecting critical infrastructure, Mr. Putin said at the time.\n",
      "Media-freedom advocacy groups criticized Mr. Gershkovich's detention, which is the first of a foreign journalist since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, according to Reporters Without Borders. The France-based group is \"alarmed by what looks like retaliation against journalists,\" said spokeswoman Pauline Ades-Mevel. \"Journalists must not be targeted, even if unfortunately they have been regularly since the invasion.\"\n",
      "Mr. Gershkovich is the first U.S. journalist detained on espionage charges in Russia that the Committee to Protect Journalists has documented since the 1986 detention of Nicholas Daniloff.\n",
      "\"CPJ is deeply concerned by the arrest of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. This is the latest in a long line of attempts by Russia to use national security laws to silence reporting. We urge his immediate release,\" said CPJ President Jodie Ginsberg.\n",
      "According to CPJ, 363 journalists were imprisoned around the world as of December, including 199 held on allegations of \"antistate\" activities. Wall Street Journal reporters have been detained in other countries, but rarely, if ever, formally arrested.\n",
      "Reporter Dion Nissenbaum in 2016 was detained in Istanbul for more than two days over a social-media post and then released by Turkish authorities without being charged. In China, over recent decades many Journal reporters have been detained for brief periods, and, in 2020, almost all Journal reporters were expelled.\n",
      "In 1987, Cairo-based reporter Gerald Seib was detained for several days in Iran after being invited by the government and accused of being a Zionist spy traveling on a fake passport. Iranian officials later said his detention resulted from a misunderstanding.\n",
      "Mr. Gershkovich since joining the Journal has covered a variety of Russia-related topics, including the recent visit by Chinese leader Xi Jinping to Moscow, close associates of Mr. Putin and tensions between Kremlin officials and Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of Russian paramilitary group Wagner.\n",
      "After initially withdrawing their correspondents from the country early in the war, some news organizations have restored their Russia-based reporters, and the Russian Foreign Ministry has continued to extend accreditation to some foreign journalists.\n",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday said \"those who carry out normal journalistic activities, of course, if they have valid accreditation, they will continue to work.\"\n",

      "Full text: Before the NCAA women's basketball tournament began, oddsmakers said South Carolina had a 73.3% chance of winning. Not winning its first game or two, but the whole thing, meaning six in a row including the championship.\n",
      "Anyone who's scratched out a bracket for the 68-team men's or women's tournaments -- only to see it turn to garden mulch by Day 3 -- knows that odds like those aren't just rare. They're downright preposterous.\n",
      "And yet here are the No. 1 seeded Gamecocks, headed to their third consecutive Final Four and what they hope will be their second consecutive national title. On Friday they'll face sharpshooting Caitlin Clark and No. 2 seed Iowa in a matchup that's the hottest ticket on record: On Wednesday, tickets for the semifinals in Dallas were reselling for $272, the highest average for a Women's Final Four entry since ticket marketplace Vivid Seats started tracking data in 2010.\n",
      "Although South Carolina has its share of stars -- most notably 2022 national player of the year Aliyah Boston -- Coach Dawn Staley's squad is more remarkable for its colossal sturdiness. The Gamecocks are on a 42-game winning streak dating to last season. They're balanced on both ends of the floor, the nation's top team in rebounding and blocked shots.\n",
      "But where South Carolina really crushes souls is in the waves of reinforcements it can send at opponents, like lines of fresh players in hockey. The Gamecocks' bench scores 36 points per game, or nearly 45% of the team's offense. Staley can go with almost any lineup, at almost any time, and know South Carolina can win.\n",
      "\"The simple fact is, we have great players in the starting lineup but we also have great players on the bench,\" said Fred Chmiel, a South Carolina assistant coach. \"So [Staley] doesn't hesitate to sub somebody in if someone looks fatigued or they're not on their best game, or they're hobbled a little bit. She has no pause in just subbing in somebody and letting them play.\"\n",
      "Through the regular season, South Carolina starters played a combined 105 minutes a game, the fewest among the nation's top 25 teams. By comparison, Iowa's starters played 145 minutes. The two other Final Four teams' starters also played considerably more than South Carolina's starters: LSU's played 140 minutes, and Virginia Tech's played 160 minutes.\n",
      "Even the Gamecocks' star, Boston, spent 15 of every 40 minutes a game on the bench during the regular season.\n",
      "Although Boston's stats were better last year, when she averaged a double-double, Staley said in a news conference Tuesday, \"I think this year is the best year of her career because she's able to pivot, she's able to give us what we need when we need it.\"\n",
      "South Carolina has found its stars are willing to defer to the common good: winning its third national title in seven years.\n",
      "Even in an age of liberal NCAA transfer rules, the Gamecocks have had a total of just four players transfer out before finishing their undergraduate eligibility over the past five seasons, according to a team official. South Carolina's core -- Boston, Zia Cooke, Brea Beal and Victaria Saxton -- has stuck around for four years.\n",
      "South Carolina's runaway victories have given it the benefit of resting its starters. The Gamecocks are winning by an average of nearly 30 points a game. But having such a deep roster, and playing so many players double-digit minutes a game, is also a strategy.\n",
      "\"We have a suffocating style of defense,\" Chmiel said. \"There's always a high amount of energy, intensity within that 40 minutes. It would be extremely hard for a player to play 40 minutes for us.\"\n",
      "Laeticia Amihere is a perfect example of the player buy-in South Carolina has achieved. The 6-foot-4 senior forward from Mississauga, Ontario, was a top-10 player out of high school. She played for Canada in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. She's a projected pick in the upcoming WNBA Draft.\n",
      "At South Carolina she comes off the bench, averaging 7.1 points and 3.3 rebounds in 15 minutes a game.\n",
      "\"I just want to make it to the next level. So whatever I have to do to do that, I'm happy,\" Amihere said.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTON -- The House voted 225 to 204 to pass Republicans' wide-ranging energy agenda, a collection of proposals designed to boost oil and gas production and accelerate new projects while striking a contrast with the Biden administration's emphasis on shifting to greener sources.\n",
      "The bill represents Republicans' opening wish list as members of both parties seek a way forward on energy policy, amid concerns over high prices, climate change and overseas threats. The GOP legislation is designed to boost oil and gas output, increase mining of critical minerals in the U.S. and revamp the National Environmental Policy Act permitting process to streamline reviews for coming projects.\n",
      "The bill is \"focused on lowering energy costs for families that have been out of control and putting in sound, responsible policies that actually allow us to produce energy in America,\" said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R., La.).\n",
      "The bill, dubbed the \"Lower Energy Costs Act\" has been given the H.R. 1 moniker by House Republicans, signifying it as a priority this Congress. The legislation has little chance of becoming law, but some elements could be part of talks with Democrats later this year, and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) has floated changes to energy policy as a condition for agreeing to raise the nation's debt ceiling.\n",
      "President Biden has taken some executive actions to limit the use of fossil fuels and make it easier for renewable energy to be expanded.\n",
      "Democratic leaders are opposed to the House bill, which they have dubbed the \"polluters over people\" act, a dig at GOP efforts to help fossil-fuel companies. The bill isn't expected to get a vote in the Senate, where Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has called it dead on arrival.\n",
      "Mr. Biden this week said he would veto the bill if it came to his desk. \"Many Democrats and Republicans understand that we need a bipartisan, bicameral approach to produce a serious energy package,\" said Mr. Schumer.\n",
      "Four Democrats voted for the GOP-led proposal: Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas as well as Jared Golden of Maine and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington. One Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, voted against the measure.\n",
      "Mr. Gonzalez said the permitting aspect of the bill is important for Democratic policies to move forward.\n",

      "Full text: The Biden administration condemned the detention of a Wall Street Journal reporter in Russia for what Moscow described as espionage, the first such case of an American journalist detained for allegations of spying since the Cold War.\n",
      "The arrest of 31-year-old Evan Gershkovich, a Russian speaker whose parents came to the U.S. from the Soviet Union, marked the latest diplomatic flashpoint between Moscow and Washington. The two countries, already on opposite sides of a war in Ukraine , have also clashed over the arrests of each other's citizens and\n",
      "the state of nuclear arms treaties .\n",
      "President Biden was briefed on the detention of Mr. Gershkovich, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. She reiterated earlier State Department warnings that Americans are urged to avoid traveling to Russia.\n",
      "\"We've been very clear about Americans not going to Russia. It is not safe,\" Ms. Jean-Pierre said.\n",
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the U.S. seeks immediate consular access to Mr. Gershkovich so that it can provide the appropriate support.\n",
      "\"In the strongest possible terms, we condemn the Kremlin's continued attempts to intimidate, repress, and punish journalists and civil society voices,\" Mr. Blinken said.\n",
      "Russia's main security agency said Thursday that it had detained Mr. Gershkovich in the city of Yekaterinburg, around 800 miles east of Moscow, on Wednesday while he was on a reporting trip, accusing him of espionage.\n",
      "\"The Wall Street Journal vehemently denies the allegations from the FSB and seeks the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter, Evan Gershkovich,\" the Journal said. \"We stand in solidarity with Evan and his family.\"\n",
      "National Security Council Strategic Coordinator John Kirby said it wasn't immediately clear if Mr. Gershkovich's detention was coordinated with Russian leadership, or aimed as retaliation for other grievances . Last week, Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov, 37, a Russian national, was charged in a U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., with acting as an agent of a foreign power, visa fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud and other charges stemming from his alleged illegal activities in the U.S., according to the Justice Department.\n",
      "Russia's Federal Security Bureau said Mr. Gershkovich, \"acting on the instructions of the American side, collected information constituting a state secret about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex.\" Mr. Gershkovich is accredited to work as a journalist in Russia by the country's foreign ministry.\n",
      "Authorities took Mr. Gershkovich to Moscow, where he appeared in court with a state-appointed defense attorney and was ordered held in custody until May 29, said the press service of the court, according to state news agency TASS.\n",
      "In Russia, espionage trials are often conducted in secret and it is rare for a court to acquit a defendant. Trials can take months to unfold.\n",
      "\"It's a new low in the U.S.-Russia relationship,\" said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. The arrest of an accredited American reporter \"is really setting a precedent.\"\n",
      "Former Vice President Mike Pence called on the Biden administration to expel Russian diplomats from the U.S.\n",
      "\"It's time for the Biden administration to make it clear with Putin that we're not going to put up with his provocations, we're not going to put up with bullying reporters,\" said Mr. Pence on CNN Thursday. Mr. Pence is considering running for the GOP presidential nomination in 2024.\n",
      "In December, the U.S. released convicted Russian arms-trafficker Viktor Bout in an exchange for U.S. women's basketball star Brittney Griner, whom Russian authorities had detained in the days before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n",
      "She was found to be carrying hashish oil in her luggage and was later convicted of drug smuggling and possession. Ms. Griner was sentenced to nine years in a penal colony.\n",
      "The White House and the Kremlin remain entangled over Russia's detention since 2018 of former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan on espionage charges.\n",
      "Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, asked about the chance of an exchange for Mr. Gershkovich, said it was premature to discuss the issue.\n",
      "\"I would not even raise the question right now\" because past exchanges involved people already serving sentences, Mr. Ryabkov was quoted by state newswire RIA Novosti as saying Thursday. \"We'll see how this story develops further.\"\n",
      "Mr. Gershkovich's detention sparked a diplomatic outcry from countries that viewed Russia's actions as unacceptable and a reflection of Russia's systemic indifference to media freedom.\n",
      "Dame Karen Pierce, the British ambassador to Washington, said the incident reflects Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"total disregard for basic freedoms.\" Josep Borrell Fontelles, the high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy, said that \"journalists must be allowed to exercise their profession freely and deserve protection.\"\n",
      "Mr. Gershkovich dropped out of contact with his editors while working in Yekaterinburg on Wednesday afternoon.\n",
      "A post later appeared on Telegram describing a man with his face hidden being bundled from a restaurant in the city and put into a waiting van. It couldn't be determined whether the person was Mr. Gershkovich.\n",
      "A lawyer hired by the Journal attempted to find Mr. Gershkovich at the FSB building in Yekaterinburg but was told authorities had no information about him.\n",
      "Mr. Gershkovich subsequently surfaced in Moscow, where he was represented by a court-appointed lawyer.\n",
      "According to TASS, which cited unnamed sources, Mr. Gershkovich pleaded not guilty at the closed hearing. His case, according to TASS, is considered top secret.\n",
      "Mr. Gershkovich joined the Journal in January 2022. He has worked as a reporter in Russia since 2017, first for the Moscow Times and then for Agence France-Presse. Earlier, he was a news assistant in New York for the New York Times. A graduate of Bowdoin College, he most recently wrote about the impact of Western sanctions on Russia's economy .\n",
      "Friends and colleagues know him as an enterprising journalist who tackled his new role with energy and courage at a time when covering Mr. Putin's Russia grew more difficult amid a contracting space for freedom of expression and media.\n",
      "\"It was becoming such a frustrating job, and here comes Evan, so full of energy,\" said Nataliya Vasilyeva, a correspondent for Britain's Telegraph who knew Mr. Gershkovich in Moscow. \"It was so amazing to watch him who didn't have this baggage.\"\n",
      "Mr. Gershkovich was born to a father from Odessa and a mother from St. Petersburg, both Jewish immigrants who settled in the U.S. after leaving the Soviet Union. He mastered the Russian language as an adult living in Moscow, according to friends and colleagues. His understanding of the language and affinity for the Russian people gave him an advantage as a journalist, colleagues said.\n",
      "\"He knew he was American but he also felt very much at home. He traveled around Russia, he felt he was a Muscovite,\" said Ms. Vasilyeva.\n",
      "Reporting in Russia has become much more difficult since Mr. Putin in February last year launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine and then cracked down on domestic dissent.\n",
      "Russia last March passed a censorship law that makes it illegal to publish what authorities deem false information about military operations in Ukraine. In response, many domestic news outlets ceased operations or left the country, and foreign media significantly restricted reporting inside Russia and withdrew many staff.\n",
      "Mr. Putin in October tightened restrictions across Russian society with a presidential decree granting local governments in the country's regions new authority to address security concerns. The measures were aimed at maintaining public order, boosting industrial production in support of the military campaign and protecting critical infrastructure, Mr. Putin said at the time.\n",
      "Media-freedom advocacy groups criticized Mr. Gershkovich's detention, which is the first of a foreign journalist since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, according to Reporters Without Borders. The France-based group is \"alarmed by what looks like retaliation against journalists,\" said spokeswoman Pauline Ades-Mevel. \"Journalists must not be targeted, even if unfortunately they have been regularly since the invasion.\"\n",
      "Mr. Gershkovich is the first U.S. journalist detained on espionage charges in Russia that the Committee to Protect Journalists has documented since the 1986 detention of Nicholas Daniloff.\n",
      "\"CPJ is deeply concerned by the arrest of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. This is the latest in a long line of attempts by Russia to use national security laws to silence reporting. We urge his immediate release,\" said CPJ President Jodie Ginsberg.\n",
      "According to CPJ, 363 journalists were imprisoned around the world as of December, including 199 held on allegations of \"antistate\" activities. Wall Street Journal reporters have been detained in other countries but rarely if ever formally arrested.\n",
      "Reporter Dion Nissenbaum in 2016 was detained in Istanbul for more than two days over a social-media post and then released by Turkish authorities without being charged. In China, over recent decades many Journal reporters have been detained for brief periods, and, in 2020, almost all Journal reporters were expelled.\n",
      "In 1987, Cairo-based reporter Gerald Seib was detained for several days in Iran after being invited by the government and accused of being a Zionist spy traveling on a fake passport. Iranian officials later said his detention resulted from a misunderstanding.\n",
      "Mr. Gershkovich since joining the Journal has covered a variety of Russia-related topics, including the recent visit by Chinese leader Xi Jinping to Moscow, close associates of Mr. Putin and tensions between Kremlin officials and Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of Russian paramilitary group Wagner.\n",
      "After initially withdrawing their correspondents from the country early in the war, some news organizations have restored their Russia-based reporters, and the Russian Foreign Ministry has continued to extend accreditation to some foreign journalists.\n",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that \"those who carry out normal journalistic activities, of course, if they have valid accreditation, they will continue to work.\"\n",

      "Full text: IN THE WORDS of guitarist David St. Hubbins, there's a fine line between stupid and clever. Parked squarely over the line is the 2022 GMC Hummer EV Edition 1, General Motors' all-electric off-road truck.\n",
      "Whatever mean tweet you could compose about GM's colossal electric sport-utility truck (SUT), I'm here for it. This 9,063-pound, 1,000-hp, six-figure spectacle of modern automaking comes equipped with everything but a sense of decency. And yet I caution against snap judgments and easy dismissals. The Hummer truck might be dumb as a hammer, but as hammers go, it's pretty ingenious.\n",
      "These things are still rare. Deliveries began in December 2021 but production at GM's new Factory Zero was paused in November, with a reported 5,000 produced. In the meantime GM has teed up production of the Hummer EV SUV as well as the GMC Sierra Denali EV pickup, all using the new BT1 electric skateboard and modular Ultium battery pack.\n",
      "I finally managed to rent an Edition 1 last week, in Florida, at the height of spring break, which might not have been my first choice. When I got to Daytona Beach, with the intention of driving on the famous strand, the streets were near-'bout roaring with young wastrels in hot cars and hitched-up pickups, or else rapping their rage-addled motorbikes from light to light. None of these delightful people seemed like they were going to sleep anytime soon.\n",
      "Lucky me. I had stumbled upon the Hummer's aspirational sensibility. Among these sunburned ballers and players-in-waiting, America's future super-consumers, the truck arrived like an absolute A-list star. Wow. The kids went bonkers. The mayor of Daytona Beach might as well have given me the keycard to the city.\n",
      "After two days in the eye of this Instagrammed hurricaneâ€”and a couple of easy stoplight victories over the fast and the curiousâ€”I started wanting to believe in GM's strategic vision for the Hummer brand, which means to advance vehicle electrification through the power of male idiocy.\n",
      "Consider the name, reviving a brand that embodied the most knavish sensibilities of American auto culture in the 2000s. Or observe its Soviet-style proportions: 18 feet long, 86.7 inches wide with the mirrors folded and 79.1 inches tallâ€”with adjustable pneumatic suspension able to lift the belly of the beast another 5.8 inches, to a maximum 15.9 inches.\n",
      "The truck's arrival at a hotel valet stand is a daunting, prodigious moment. Guests start looking around for virgins to sacrifice.\n",
      "Sure, if strict reason ruled, GM's first proper electric pickup would have been smooth-skinned and aerodynamically efficient. Instead, it looks kickass and amazing! Coldly technical, chiseled and chamfered, with a mouthful of skid plate and 35-inch mudders that churn in cavernous wheel wells like machinery you don't want to fall into.\n",
      "Naturally, given its Borg-cube shape, the drag factors are high and, consequently, energy consumption goes from bad to terrible the faster you go. The estimated range is 329 miles. The renter reported he had gone over 400 miles by keeping below 55 mph. But at a Florida-friendly 80 mph, the real-world range looked more like 270 miles. The wind noise is so high you can barely hear the hip-hop blasting from the next vehicle.\n",
      "Ideally, it would be easier to see out of. As it is, the truck's high sills and squinting greenhouse create a veritable panopticon of blind spots. For that reason it is, and must be, bristling with cameras, 9 in total. Small price to pay for looking so dope.\n",
      "As a preview of future solutions from GM, there is lots to love. The sober and sophisticated cabin design, the material choices, the spare but modern switchgear, the smart and snappy graphical environmentâ€”the interior gets four stars. Fit and finish was excellent. Compared with the underbaked Rivian R1T I tested , the Hummer looked like it was assembled in a NASA clean room.\n",
      "Among the more beguiling features: four huge removable roof panels of blue-tinted glass. It's like a bro terrarium.\n",
      "It's certainly athletic for earth-moving equipment. Three electric motors, one between the front wheels and two between the rear, direct a combined maximum of 1,000 hp and 1,200 pound-feet to the ground. With the launch-assist engaged the truck can huck itself to 60 mph in as little as 3 seconds, according to GM. And thus something the weight of a well-equipped ambulance will accelerate like a top-line Porsche 911. Progress!\n",
      "I was never so premeditated. Whenever I needed to overtake, I just willed it so. Within the space of a couple inches of pedal travel, the Hummer EV will squat luridly then seem to fire itself out of its own superconducting railgun.\n",
      "The famous beach was closed for traffic but I found some well-groomed acreage in an out-of-the-way construction zone in which to disport. Before wading into the soft, foot-deep sand, I engaged Terrain mode, which fully liberates the rear steering system, allowing a sharper steering angle. This is the mischief mode: All you need to do is crank the wheel hard and floor it, and the truck will augur itself into a tidy circular hole in the ground.\n",
      "In many ways I found the Hummer truck strangely impervious to criticism. The biggest knock is its alarming 4.5-ton curb weight, nearly a third of which is battery. That is definitely not optimum. Due to the pack's mass, the truck's payload capacity is that of a midsize truck and the braking distances are like that of small civilian aircraft. It took Car and Driver 504 feet to whoa one of these down from 100 mph.\n",
      "But better, lighter, more compact, more energy-dense batteries are coming. Everything else about the Hummer is ready and waiting, and kind of terrific.\n",
      "In the meantime, stay off wooden bridges.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTONâ€”The House on Thursday voted 225 to 204 to pass Republicans' wide-ranging energy agenda, a collection of proposals designed to boost oil and gas production and accelerate new projects while striking a contrast with the Biden administration's emphasis on shifting to greener sources .\n",
      "The bill represents Republicans' opening wish list as members of both parties seek a way forward on energy policy, amid concerns over high prices, climate change and overseas threats .\n",

      "The bill, dubbed the \"Lower Energy Costs Act\" has been given the H.R. 1 moniker by House Republicans, signifying it as a priority this Congress. The legislation has little chance of becoming law, but some elements could be part of talks with Democrats later this year, and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) has floated changes to energy policy as a condition for agreeing to raise the nation's debt ceiling.\n",
      "President Biden, who calls climate change an emergency, has taken some executive actions to limit the use of fossil fuels and make it easier for renewable energy to be expanded. Last year, he signed into law sweeping legislation that boosted the renewable-energy sector .\n",
      "Democratic leaders are opposed to the House bill, which they have dubbed the \"polluters over people\" act, a dig at GOP efforts to help fossil-fuel companies. The bill isn't expected to get a vote in the Senate, where Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has called it dead on arrival. Mr. Biden this week said he would veto the bill if it came to his desk.\n",
      "\"Many Democrats and Republicans understand that we need a bipartisan, bicameral approach to produce a serious energy package,\" said Mr. Schumer. \"Our side will continue working in good faith on real permitting reform talks.\"\n",
      "Four Democrats voted for the GOP-led proposal: Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas as well as Jared Golden of Maine and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington. One Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, voted against the measure.\n",
      "Mr. Gonzalez said the permitting aspect of the bill is important for Democratic policies to move forward. The bill seeks to change the process of how utility-scale energy projects such as power-transmission lines and offshore wind farms are approved. Typically, the projects have to win approval from authorities in several jurisdictions , which can take years.\n",
      "\"While this package is far from perfect, it is a step forward,\" he said.\n",
      "Other Democrats have embraced permitting as a priority. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) helped push through Mr. Biden's climate policy bill last year, but a companion bill he supported to speed up the permitting process stalled. While airing his frustration over that, he has also lashed out at the administration over what he says is improper implementation of the 2022 law, dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act.\n",
      "He is concerned that the administrations' interpretation of the legislation is moving the IRA away from its original intent of boosting domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains for critical minerals needed to produce electric vehicles and other products.\n",
      "Administration officials are \"ignoring the law's intent to support and expand fossil energy and are redefining 'domestic energy' to increase clean-energy spending to potentially deficit-breaking levels,\" he wrote in an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday . Mr. Manchin's article was published just as the Treasury Department is set to release new rules on the sourcing of battery contents and minerals for the IRA's electric-vehicle tax-credit program.\n",
      "\"We'll see how it works out,\" Mr. Manchin said this week when asked about the GOP energy bill.\n",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the White House will continue to work with Mr. Manchin on \"shared priorities and values\" including reducing the deficit and pursuing permitting changes.\n",
      "Some House Republicans have signaled a willingness to separate the legislation into parts, to see if more senators may jump on board to passing portions of the bill, such as permitting changes.\n",
      "\"If you can't get [a project] in the ground, you can't deploy those electrons on the grid from an offshore wind farm the same way as you can't deploy those electrons from a coal plant in North Dakota,\" said Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R., N.D.).\n",
      "GOP leadership opened the legislation up to several amendments, allowing for lawmakers to amend the bill in floor votes. Several were adopted, including one by freshman Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R., Fla.) that requires the government to study the impact of wind energy on military readiness, the marine environment and tourism, before the secretary of the Interior Department can pursue development off the coast of Florida.\n",
      "Republicans argue that Mr. Biden's policies have hampered the production of fossil fuels and driven up energy prices as a result. They say that the Biden administration shouldn't look around the world to import oil and precious minerals, but instead boost production in the U.S.\n",
      "The Biden administration has leased fewer acres for oil-and-gas drilling offshore and on federal land in the first two years of his administration than any of his predecessors during a comparable time frame dating back to the end of World War II, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis.\n",
      "The administration has pushed oil and fracking companies to use the permits they do have, while some companies have held off , not wanting to run out of prime locations. Some oil executives concede that investor pressure, inflation and labor and equipment shortages have done more to curtail oil production than Mr. Biden's climate policies.\n",
      "Republicans have pointed to the Biden administration this year blocking mining upstream of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area of Northern Minnesota for 20 years, opting to protect a pristine wilderness over allowing production of minerals that could help produce clean-energy projects.\n",
      "The administration last year also canceled two federal mineral rights leases held by Twin Metals Minnesota LLC, a unit of Chilean mining firm Antofagasta Minerals SA. The latest move could kill the company's planned underground copper-nickel mine, although Twin Metals said it would continue to fight the cancellation.\n",
      "The Biden administration earlier this month approved a massive Willow oil-drilling project in Alaska , over the objections of environmentalists and many Democrats. The administration also announced a plan to block future oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Ocean's federal waters and issue new federal rules limiting oil and gas leasing on 13 million acres of Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve.\n",

      "Full text: Before the NCAA women's basketball tournament began, oddsmakers said South Carolina had a 73.3% chance of winning. Not winning its first game or two, but the whole thing, meaning six in a row including the championship.\n",
      "Anyone who's scratched out a bracket for the 68-team men's or women's tournamentsâ€”only to see it turn to garden mulch by Day 3â€”knows that odds like those aren't just rare. They're downright preposterous.\n",
      "And yet here are the No. 1 seeded Gamecocks, headed to their third consecutive Final Four and what they hope will be their second consecutive national title. On Friday they'll face sharpshooting Caitlin Clark and No. 2 seed Iowa in a matchup that's the hottest ticket on record: On Wednesday, tickets for the semifinals in Dallas were reselling for $272, the highest average for a Women's Final Four entry since ticket marketplace Vivid Seats started tracking data in 2010.\n",
      "Although South Carolina has its share of starsâ€”most notably 2022 national player of the year Aliyah Bostonâ€”Coach Dawn Staley's squad is more remarkable for its colossal sturdiness. The Gamecocks are on a 42-game winning streak dating to last season. They're balanced on both ends of the floor, the nation's top team in rebounding and blocked shots.\n",
      "But where South Carolina really crushes souls is in the waves of reinforcements it can send at opponents, like lines of fresh players in hockey. The Gamecocks' bench scores 36 points per game, or nearly 45% of the team's offense. Staley can go with almost any lineup, at almost any time, and know South Carolina can win.\n",
      "\"The simple fact is, we have great players in the starting lineup but we also have great players on the bench,\" said Fred Chmiel, a South Carolina assistant coach. \"So [Staley] doesn't hesitate to sub somebody in if someone looks fatigued or they're not on their best game, or they're hobbled a little bit. She has no pause in just subbing in somebody and letting them play.\"\n",
      "Through the regular season, South Carolina starters played a combined 105 minutes a game, the fewest among the nation's top 25 teams. By comparison, Iowa's starters played 145 minutes. The two other Final Four teams' starters also played considerably more than South Carolina's starters: LSU's played 140 minutes, and Virginia Tech's played 160 minutes.\n",
      "Even the Gamecocks' star, Boston, spent 15 of every 40 minutes a game on the bench during the regular season.\n",
      "Although Boston's stats were better last year, when she averaged a double-double, Staley said in a press conference Tuesday, \"I think this year is the best year of her career because she's able to pivot, she's able to give us what we need when we need it.\"\n",
      "South Carolina has found its stars are willing to defer to the common good: winning its third national title in seven years.\n",
      "Even in an age of liberal NCAA transfer rules, the Gamecocks have had a total of just four players transfer out before finishing their undergraduate eligibility over the past five seasons, according to a team official. South Carolina's coreâ€”Boston, Zia Cooke, Brea Beal and Victaria Saxtonâ€”has stuck around for four years.\n",
      "Certainly, South Carolina's runaway victories have given it the benefit of resting its starters. The Gamecocks are winning by an average of nearly 30 points a game. But having such a deep roster, and playing so many players double-digit minutes a game, is also a strategy.\n",
      "\"We have a suffocating style of defense,\" Chmiel said. \"And then offensively, we push to score on makes and misses. So we're always running the floor. There's always a high amount of energy, intensity within that 40 minutes. It would be extremely hard for a player to play 40 minutes for us.\"\n",
      "Chmiel acknowledged that competing programs use South Carolina's depth against it in recruiting, telling top players won't see the court much there. He counters that by pointing to Boston's playing timeâ€”and her achievements.\n",
      "\"She's still All-American,\" he said. \"She's still been player of the year, defensive player of the year, all-conference. She plays 25 minutes. That allows somebody else to get 15 minutes on the average. So if you're a freshman coming in, you know you're not going to sit there and watch an entire game, that there's 15 minutes available to play.\"\n",
      "Laeticia Amihere is a perfect example of the player buy-in South Carolina has achieved. The 6-foot-4 senior forward from Mississauga, Ontario, was a top-10 player out of high school. She played for Canada in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. She's a projected pick in the upcoming WNBA Draft.\n",
      "At South Carolina she comes off the bench, averaging 7.1 points and 3.3 rebounds in 15 minutes a game.\n",
      "\"I think we've just been kind of lucky in that way where we're able to push a lead and we're able to play, like, our third string and still be able to excel,\" Amihere said. \"Obviously I just want to make it to the next level. So whatever I have to do to do that, I'm happy.\"\n",
      "There, again, South Carolina turns less playing time into a selling point.\n",
      "\"AAU basketball goes the majority of the year before they get here,\" Chmiel said. \"They get no breaks. It goes right into scholastic basketball. They get no breaks. So I mean, they're playing four straight years and then they're going to come here and log 32 games, so 120 more games. That's a lot of minutes.\"\n",
      "If seniors are good enough, they'll go directly into the WNBA season, then probably play for an overseas team in the offseason.\n",
      "\"So we embrace the fact that we can sit them down and rest them,\" Chmiel said.\n",
      "That luxury has given South Carolina another advantage: one of the best-rested teams at the Final Four.\n",

      "Full text: Coal prices have come crashing down from last year's records.\n",
      "Central Appalachian coal has been trading at $88.80 a short ton, down 57% from the record $205.55 at the start of the year.\n",
      "Cash prices for thermal coal mined from northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basinâ€”two places where a lot of exported coal originatesâ€”have fallen more than half since September, when Europe was stocking up for winter . Futures for coal that is shipped around the Pacific from an Australian export facility have made a similar plunge.\n",
      "Coal markets are highly influenced by those for natural gas , which is also burned to generate electricity. As with coal, natural-gas inventories that looked alarmingly low last summer recovered thanks to unusually warm winter weather that obviated a lot of demand for heating.\n",
      "Natural-gas futures for May delivery ended Thursday at $2.104 per million British thermal unit, down 63% from a year ago.\n",
      "Even after the decline in coal prices, varieties produced in the eastern U.S. have lately cost between $3.10 to $3.55 per million BTUs, according to the Energy Information Administration. That suggests that coal prices might have to fall further to regain competitiveness with natural gas.\n",
      "Coal also faces increased competition from renewables , including wind, solar, hydropower and biomass, which last year accounted for more U.S. power generation than coal for the first time ever , federal record-keepers say.\n",
      "Coal remains expensive relative to prepandemic prices, but its rapid deflation shows that power producers around the world are confident enough in their supplies to stop bidding up cargoes.\n",
      "\"We went from undersupplied to oversupplied very quickly,\" said Andy Blumenfeld, data analytics director at McCloskey by OPIS, a pricing service that is part of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co.\n",
      "Prices started surging in 2021, when power producers fired up coal-burning generators to keep air conditioners running during some of the hottest temperatures on record. Stockpiles at U.S. power plants shrank to their lowest level since the Nixon administration .\n",
      "A ban on Russian exports following the invasion of Ukraine further crimped supplies while the highest natural-gas prices in years and the prospect of shortages pushed up what power generators were willing to pay for coal.\n",
      "By the summer of 2022â€” another scorcher â€”power producers on both sides of the Atlantic were competing for a limited supply of unsold coal. North American power generators' stockpiles dwindled to as little as 58 days' worth of coal, nearly a month less than the five-year average, according to energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.\n",
      "Congestion at ports and along rail lines ensnared cargoes, prompting grid operators and utilities to take unusual steps to curtail coal use before the weather turned cold. In Colorado, Xcel Energy Inc.'s state subsidiary dialed back how much coal it burned in favor of natural gas, even as the competing fuel's price spiked to shale-era highs.\n",
      "\"Given the fact that we were seeing delays and shortages in the delivery of coal, we made the prudent call that we would use less coal so that we could conserve that in advance of the winter heating season,\" said Robert Kenney, president of Xcel Energy's Colorado arm.\n",
      "Warm winter weather left a lot of coal unburned, though. Between December and January U.S. inventories grew by 4.6% at a time of year when they typically decline, according to EIA data.\n",
      "As they raced to stock up, utilities ordered all the coal they could, much of which is scheduled to be delivered this year and could create a glut, analysts say.\n",
      "For decades coal was the primary fuel burned to generate electricity in the U.S. Since 2010, though, U.S. coal-fired generating capacity has dropped more than 36% amid concerns about emissions and the abundance of gas unleashed by the shale-drilling boom , according to FactSet. Power plant owners are expected to retire another 4.5% of coal-fired capacity this year, according to the EIA.\n",
      "As coal-burning capacity has dwindled, so has financing for speculative production. Miners now sell most of their output in advance, with not much more to sell if demand is greater than expected.\n",
      "Big mining companies have told investors that they are mostly sold out for 2023. It is possible that power producers have overbought and will try to resell their coal in export markets or renegotiate deals with their suppliers, which could add downward pressure to prices, McCloskey's Mr. Blumenfeld said.\n",
      "Already, he said, some utilities are burning coal to make space for incoming deliveries even though it has become uneconomical.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Biden said he needs to see House Republicans' budget proposal to start negotiations related to raising the nation's borrowing limit. House Republicans' response: not going to happen.\n",
      "The chairman of the House Budget Committee, Texas Rep. Jodey Arrington, said in an interview that the GOP budget process could take months to play out, pushing it past the deadline for Congress to act on raising the debt ceiling and avoid a U.S. default on debt payments and other government obligations. Instead, he and other top Republicans want to start talks immediately on a shorter list of demands for this year, without a formal budget in hand.\n",
      "\"The more urgent matter is to address the debt ceiling and negotiate spending limitations and broader fiscal reforms in the process,\" Mr. Arrington said. On when Republicans could produce a budget, the Texas lawmaker said he would be disappointed if the House didn't pass a budget resolution before the end of the fiscal year in September.\n",
      "GOP lawmakers want spending reductions and policy changes as a condition for raising the debt limit. Mr. Biden has said the debt ceiling should be raised with no conditions attached, while saying he is open to a separate debate over fiscal policy once Republicans produce a budget.\n",
      "The Treasury Department ran up against the roughly $31.4 trillion debt limit in January. It is now deploying special accounting maneuvers to keep paying the government's obligations. The U.S. could become unable to pay all of its bills as soon as this summer.\n",
      "Mr. Arrington pointed to a list of priorities presented by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) as the opening bid for Republicans in their negotiations with the White House. The list, referenced in a letter Mr. McCarthy sent Tuesday to Mr. Biden, includes rolling back top-line spending to fiscal 2022 levels and locking in small annual increases from there, as well as clawing back unspent Covid-19 funds, strengthening work requirements for government programs and making changes to energy policy.\n",
      "In his letter, Mr. McCarthy said that talks should begin immediately.\n",
      "The White House released its own budget proposal earlier this month, which includes tax increases designed to narrow the budget deficit. Mr. Biden said Tuesday that he wanted to see Mr. McCarthy's budget plan before Easter recess -- which starts Friday -- before beginning talks. While neither budget would have a chance of becoming law, they serve to outline the parties' policy intentions.\n",
      "Under the law, Congress is supposed to release a budget resolution in April, though lawmakers from both parties have failed to meet that deadline in recent years. Mr. McCarthy had previously said the GOP budget would be delayed a short time because the president's own budget was late.\n",
      "Republicans have set a goal of balancing the budget over 10 years while extending expiring tax cuts, an effort that would require deep reductions across the government, particularly if Social Security, Medicare and defense are off the table, as lawmakers have indicated.\n",
      "Mr. Arrington said the broader overhaul of federal taxes and spending would have to wait until later this year, because of its complexities as well as the need to build GOP consensus in the closely divided House. Delaying a fuller budget, he said, would also put off anticipated political attacks that could derail talks over the debt ceiling with Mr. Biden.\n",
      "He said he didn't plan to address the solvency of Social Security and Medicare in his budget, saying instead that entitlement spending should be tackled in a bipartisan manner through separate discussions.\n",
      "The White House has said that the GOP budget effort would lay out severe cuts to federal spending, making the proposal politically radioactive for many Republican lawmakers facing re-election next year.\n",
      "\"Every week, House Republicans invent a new excuse to hide their budget from the American people even while signaling that they would impose devastating cuts,\" said White House spokesman Andrew Bates.\n",

      "Full text: The Biden administration is pushing hard for American businesses to invest in Africa despite the obstacles they face there, more than a decade after China began expanding its economic and political ties with countries across the continent.\n",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris pledged on Tuesday in Ghana's seaside capital to double down on efforts to bring billions of dollars in investments to Africa, a continent many Western investors still view as high risk. Ms. Harris is the highest ranking in a string of top White House and Biden administration officials to travel through Africa this year, promising to unlock American investment as the U.S. and China look to tap into the continent's vast natural resources.\n",
      "But U.S. and other Western investors often cite corruption, poor infrastructure and still-rampant poverty, all of which preclude easily operating across dozens of countries that all have their own rules and market peculiarities.\n",
      "U.S. interest in expanding influence on the continent comes as tensions and competition with China are rising. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, Chinese companies have spent over a decade and billions of dollars buying out U.S. and European miners in the country's cobalt and copper belt. Experts say the U.S. has a lot of ground to make up, especially in areas of strategic importance, like securing supply chains for materials such as battery metals, critical for the energy transition.\n",
      "\"The Chinese system is a lot more centralized, and state power plays a much larger role,\" said Cobus van Staden, Johannesburg-based managing editor of the China-Global South Project, formerly known as the China Africa Project, a nonprofit. \"The Chinese view on Africa has been very opportunity focused. There is this very strong focus on risk in the U.S. private sector, to the exclusion of all of the opportunities.\"\n",
      "The U.S. financed roughly $14 billion of projects on the continent from 2007 to 2020, while comparable Chinese institutions financed about $120 billion over the period, according to an analysis by Oyintarelado Moses, a data analyst with the Global China Initiative at Boston University's Global Development Policy Center, using data from the U.S. government and the Chinese Loans to Africa Database.\n",
      "Ms. Harris's trip follows visits to Africa by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield this year, but U.S. officials still face institutional hurdles to counter Chinese economic dominance on the continent.\n",
      "\"In terms of perception, I think [the U.S. is] doing everything right,\" said Gyude Moore, senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development and Liberia's former Minister of Public Works. The stumbling blocks that remain include a lack of available infrastructure financing from the U.S., easier access to higher education in China for Africans versus the U.S., and concerns that this U.S. push into Africa might be episodic, he said.\n",
      "On Wednesday, Ms. Harris announced about $1 billion of new programs and investments aimed at empowering African businesswomen -- much of it from foundations.\n",

      "Full text: DUBAI -- Saudi Arabia is strengthening its commercial and security ties with China, as U.S. influence wanes in the Middle East.\n",
      "The Saudi government approved partial membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a political and security bloc that includes China, Russia and India, the Saudi state news agency reported Wednesday. The decision comes ahead of a May meeting of foreign ministers from the regional grouping, where Iran recently gained full member status.\n",
      "The move is part of a broad effort in Saudi Arabia and some neighboring Persian Gulf countries to expand diplomatic partnerships beyond traditional Western allies in a marked pivot to the east, analysts say. It comes amid uncertainty about Washington's long-term commitment to ensure security in the strategic, energy-rich region, where the U.S. has been a dominant force for decades but is increasingly focused on a rising China and a belligerent Russia.\n",
      "In a sign of the geopolitical realignment under way, Saudi Arabia re-established diplomatic relations with rival Iran this month in a deal brokered by China that burnished Beijing's credentials as a new power broker in the region. The Saudi kingdom also is nearing a deal to restore ties with Syria following negotiations mediated by Russia.\n",
      "The SCO historically has had a heavy focus on regional security cooperation, and accelerated Saudi interactions with China and Russia there risk backlash from the U.S., which is wary of its traditional security partners in the region cozying up to its global rivals.\n",
      "\"By engaging with these U.S. rivals, it really does seem like this multipolarity is in full-bore here now,\" said Jonathan Fulton, an expert on China-Middle East relations and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. \"We're seeing what a less U.S.-centered Gulf or Middle East looks like.\"\n",
      "Analysts say China isn't trying to replace the broad American role in the Middle East, where the U.S.'s continued military presence is unrivaled, but could chip away at its supremacy in the region.\n",
      "Saudi Arabia and China are building on ties that, until now, were firmly rooted in energy and trade, as Beijing's oil imports swelled in the past three decades in line with its expanding economy.\n",
      "Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Tuesday, reaffirming their strategic relationship which Mr. Xi said was in \"the best shape of all time,\" Chinese state media said.\n",
      "China is Saudi Arabia's top trading partner. Besides oil, business has expanded to include large contracts for Chinese construction companies, widespread adoption of Chinese technology despite security concerns and the transfer of military hardware. China is also helping the Saudis fabricate uranium yellowcake, which is needed for a nuclear-energy program or nuclear-arms capability.\n",
      "Earlier this week, the two countries signed major deals that saw state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco take a $3.6 billion stake in Rongsheng Petrochemical Co. Ltd. to expand its downstream presence in China and join with Norinco Group and Panjin Xincheng Industrial Group to construct an integrated refinery and petrochemical complex in northeast China.\n",
      "The refinery and petrochemical complex is expected to produce 300,000 barrels a day at a cost of 83.7 billion yuan, or $12.2 billion. The announcements coincide with Russia overtaking Saudi Arabia as China's main oil supplier in the first two months of 2023.\n",

      "He said he didn't plan to address the solvency of Social Security and Medicare in his budget, saying instead that entitlement spending should be tackled in a bipartisan manner through separate discussions. As much as 92% of projected nominal spending growth is driven by Social Security, federal healthcare programs and interest payments on the national debt, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n",
      "Trustees for the Social Security Trust Funds projected last year that the program's combined reserves would be depleted in 2035 . Once Social Security's reserves run out, revenue would pay for roughly 80% of scheduled benefits, unless Congress steps in.\n",
      "The White House has said that the GOP budget effort would lay out severe cuts to federal spending, making the proposal politically radioactive for many Republican lawmakers facing re-election next year.\n",
      "\"Every week, House Republicans invent a new excuse to hide their budget from the American people even while signaling that they would impose devastating cuts,\" said White House spokesman Andrew Bates.\n",
      "A recent Congressional Budget Office analysis showed how difficult balancing the budget will be. Under a scenario in which Medicare and Social Security as well as military and veterans spending are protected, and expiring tax cuts are extended, even eliminating 100% of all other noninterest federal spending would still result in a small deficit.\n",
      "Mr. Arrington said that the eventual GOP proposal would make significant progress in closing the deficit but might not hit the goal of balancing the budget in a decade, based on trade-offs needed to get enough GOP votes to pass the package. He compared the effort to herding butterflies, calling his colleagues \"lively, colorful and unwieldy.\"\n",
      "On balancing the budget, he said, \"whether it's 10 years, whether it's 10 or 12, or 15â€¦you will know the direction and the policies that drive our directional difference between the president and our Republican budget,\" he said.\n",

      "Full text: BERLINâ€”Britain's King Charles III is visiting Germany this week on his first official foreign trip since ascending to the throne , part of the British government's wider charm offensive with its European neighbors to move past years of feuding caused by Brexit and bolster Western support for Ukraine.\n",
      "The British government has deployed the new king in a soft-power play that aims to reinforce cultural bonds between the two nations and point to how they can work more closely together on issues such as climate change and foreign policy, British officials said. The king was also due to visit France last week, but that trip was abandoned at the behest of the French government amid mass protests in the country over a pension overhaul.\n",
      "German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who unlike his French and U.S. counterparts holds a largely ceremonial role, welcomed King Charles and Camilla, the queen consort, at the historic Brandenburg Gate on Wednesday with military honors. He is set to host a state banquet for the monarch in the evening.\n",
      "Buckingham Palace said it was the first time that a head of state was welcomed at the gate. U.S. President Ronald Reagan held a speech with the gate in the background in 1987, but this was before Germany's reunification, when the triumphal arch stood on the East side of the Berlin Wall.\n",
      "\"Today, on the day six years ago when Britain began its exit from the European Union, we are opening a new chapter,\" Mr. Steinmeier said in a speech later Wednesday.\n",
      "He said that the king's choice to visit Germany for his inaugural foreign trip as monarch was a \"great personal gesture and I think at the same time an important sign for German-British relations.\"\n",
      "Earlier, the monarch and the queen consort posted on Twitter about their \"great joy to be able to continue the deepening of the longstanding friendship between our two nations.\"\n",
      "On Thursday, the monarch is set to give a speech at Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, which he addressed in 2020 as the then-prince of Wales. He will also meet Chancellor Olaf Scholz, talk to Ukrainian refugees and meet with British and German soldiers.\n",
      "In recent months, Britain has sought to refresh ties with its European neighbors after years of acrimony following its split from the European Union. Most recently, the U.K. announced a compromise deal with the EU to end a long-running argument over trading arrangements with Northern Ireland. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak visited Paris earlier this month to heap praise on French President Emmanuel Macron .\n",
      "The king's tour to France and Germany was set to seal this rapprochement. Buckingham Palace says that the trip not only serves to reinforce relations but also to point to how the two nations can work together to tackle climate change, support Ukraine in its war with Russia and improve trading relations, which have been damaged by Brexit.\n",
      "King Charles, who is of German descent, is no stranger to Germany. In his previous role as Prince of Wales, he undertook 29 visits to the country. The royal couple will travel to the northern city of Hamburg on Friday, where they will visit a memorial of one of its main churches, which was bombed by British and American forces during World War II. While in Germany, the king, who is known for his environmental agenda, will also visit an organic farm and discuss green energy.\n",
      "In Germany, interest in the visit hasn't matched that sparked by previous trips by Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles's mother, with most large newspapers giving it only cursory treatment ahead of the trip.\n",

      "Full text: DUBAIâ€”Saudi Arabia is strengthening its commercial and security ties with China, as U.S. influence wanes in the Middle East region.\n",
      "The Saudi government approved partial membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a political and security bloc that includes China, Russia and India, the Saudi state news agency reported Wednesday. The decision comes ahead of a May meeting of foreign ministers from the regional grouping, where Iran recently gained full member status.\n",
      "The move is part of a broad effort in Saudi Arabia and some neighboring Persian Gulf countries to expand diplomatic partnerships beyond traditional Western allies in a marked pivot to the east, analysts say. It comes amid uncertainty about Washington's long-term commitment to ensure security in the strategic, energy-rich region, where the U.S. has been a dominant force for decades but is increasingly focused on a rising China and a belligerent Russia.\n",
      "In a sign of the geopolitical realignment under way in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia re-established diplomatic relations with rival Iran this month in a deal brokered by China that burnished Beijing's credentials as a new power broker in the region. The Saudi kingdom is also nearing an agreement to restore ties with Syria following negotiations mediated by Russia.\n",
      "The SCO has historically had a heavy focus on regional security cooperation, and accelerated Saudi interactions with China and Russia there risk backlash from the U.S., which is wary of its traditional security partners in the region cozying up to its global rivals.\n",
      "\"By engaging with these U.S. rivals, it really does seem like this multipolarity is in full-bore here now,\" said Jonathan Fulton, an expert on China-Middle East relations and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. \"We're seeing what a less U.S.-centered Gulf or Middle East looks like.\"\n",
      "Analysts say China isn't trying to replace the broad American role in the Middle East, where the U.S.'s continued military presence is unrivaled, but could chip away at its supremacy in the region.\n",
      "Saudi Arabia and China are building on ties that, until now, were firmly rooted in energy and trade, as Beijing's oil imports swelled over the last three decades in line with its expanding economy.\n",
      "Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Tuesday, reaffirming their strategic relationship which Mr. Xi said was in \"the best shape of all time,\" according to Chinese state media.\n",
      "China is Saudi Arabia's top trading partner. Besides oil, business has expanded to include large contracts for Chinese construction companies, widespread adoption of Chinese technology despite security concerns and the transfer of military hardware such as drones and ballistic missiles. China is also helping the Saudis fabricate uranium yellowcake, which is needed for a nuclear-energy program or nuclear-arms capability.\n",
      "Earlier this week, the two countries signed major deals that saw state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco take a $3.6 billion stake in Rongsheng Petrochemical Co. Ltd. to expand its downstream presence in China and join with Norinco Group and Panjin Xincheng Industrial Group to construct an integrated refinery and petrochemical complex in northeast China.\n",
      "The refinery and petrochemical complex is expected to produce 300,000 barrels a day at a cost of 83.7 billion yuan, equivalent to $12.2 billion. The deal was first agreed during a visit by Prince Mohammed to Beijing in 2019. Earlier in March, Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser said the company, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., was continuing to give priority to downstream assets in large markets such as China.\n",
      "\"We think China will continue to grow in terms of demand,\" Mr. Nasser said. \"We have a number of investments, but we cannot declare right now, but hopefully in the next one to two years, even through 2023, we are going to have a number of investments in China.\n",
      "The announcements by Aramco coincide with Russia overtaking Saudi Arabia as China's main oil supplier in the first two months of 2023. Saudi Arabia was China's top crude supplier in 2022, selling 1.75 million barrels a day, according to data from China's General Administration of Customs.\n",
      "Aramco had previously considered selling shares on a global exchange but eventually floated shares on its local exchange in 2019 for a $29.4 billion listing that was the world's largest-ever initial public offering .\n",
      "Hong Kong officials are now vying for a second chance at winning a secondary listing, which would be a boon for the city. By listing there, Aramco could tap demand from investors in mainland China.\n",

      "Full text: The Biden administration is pushing hard for American businesses to invest in Africa despite the obstacles they face there, more than a decade after China began expanding its economic and political ties with countries across the continent.\n",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris pledged Tuesday in Ghana's seaside capital to \"double down\" on efforts to bring billions of dollars in investments to Africa, a continent that many Western investors still view as high risk . Ms. Harris is the highest ranking in a string of top White House and Biden administration officials to travel through Africa this year, promising to unlock American investment as both the U.S. and China look to tap into the continent's vast natural resources.\n",
      "But U.S. and other Western investors often cite corruption, poor infrastructure and still rampant poverty, all of which preclude easily operating across dozens of countries that all have their own rules and market peculiarities.\n",
      "U.S. interest in expanding influence on the continent comes as tensions and competition with China are rising. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, Chinese companies have spent over a decade and billions of dollars buying out U.S. and European miners in the country's cobalt and copper belt. Experts say the U.S. has a lot of ground to make up, especially in areas of strategic importance, like securing supply chains for materials such as battery metals, critical for the energy transition.\n",
      "\"The Chinese system is a lot more centralized, and state power plays a much larger role,\" said Cobus van Staden, Johannesburg-based managing editor of the China-Global South Project, formerly known as The China Africa Project, a nonprofit. \"The Chinese view on Africa has been very opportunity focused. There is this very strong focus on risk in the U.S. private sector, to the exclusion of all of the opportunities.\"\n",
      "The U.S. financed roughly $14 billion worth of projects on the continent from 2007 to 2020, while comparable Chinese institutions financed about $120 billion over the same period of time, according to an analysis by Oyintarelado Moses, a data analyst with the Global China Initiative at Boston University's Global Development Policy Center, using data from the U.S. government and the Chinese Loans to Africa Database.\n",
      "Ms. Harris's trip follows visits to various African nations by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield this year, but U.S. officials still face deeply-entrenched institutional hurdles to counter Chinese economic dominance on the continent.\n",
      "\"In terms of perception, I think [the U.S. is] doing everything right,\" said Gyude Moore, senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development and Liberia's former Minister of Public Works. The stumbling blocks that remain include a lack of available infrastructure financing from the U.S., easier access to higher education in China for Africans versus the U.S., and concerns that this U.S. push into Africa might be episodic, he said.\n",
      "\"There's a lingering threat that a change in administration will return Africa to the cold again,\" Mr. Moore said.\n",
      "On Wednesday Ms. Harris appeared at the Mix Design Hub, a stylish, four-story office space and gallery in Accra's trendy Osu neighborhood, and announced about $1 billion of new programs and investments on the continent aimed at empowering African business women â€”much of it from foundations.\n",
      "They include nearly $500 million to provide African women more access to technology, and she said that the U.S. will join with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to launch a new fund to help close the so-called gender digital divide. Other new funds include $500 million from the Nigeria-based Tony Elumelu Foundation, with a large chunk earmarked specifically to support female entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\"There's a direct correlation between policies that are directed at the economic empowerment of women and the general prosperity of societies,\" Ms. Harris said Wednesday morning surrounded by women business-owners.\n",
      "But structural problems persist for U.S. companies that want to expand operations on the continent.\n",
      "Bobby Pittman, the founder of Kupanda Capital and an investor in Mavin Records, a leading record label on the continent, said that U.S. public lending institutions are seen as slower and more bureaucratic than their Chinese counterparts. With China, he said, \"all the financing comes with one signature,\" while the U.S. can take months to help companies finance large-scale projects on the continent.\n",
      "Others say the tide is shifting as demand in some sectors increases.\n",
      "Rob Still, a partner at Denham Capital Management LP, a U.S.-based global energy transition investment firm, said projects for commodities such as cobalt, niobium, lithium and tin would previously have been turned down immediately by more risk-averse Western development agencies because those commodities can't be hedged through an exchange on a futures marketâ€”either because the market is too thin or doesn't exist.\n",
      "Now, that is no longer the case. \"There's definitely more interest and action than there has been in the past,\" especially from the Americans, said Mr. Still, who is based in Johannesburg.\n",
      "On the second day of President Biden's summit with African leaders in Washington, D.C., in December, the U.S. government announced that KoBold Metals, a commercial startup backed by Bill Gates's Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which aims to use artificial intelligence to find metals needed for the electric-vehicle boom, agreed to invest $150 million to buy a controlling stake in a large, undeveloped copper deposit in Zambia. The deal is part of the U.S. government's new push into critical minerals in Africa.\n",
      "\"We sought out the U.S. government generally for support on our activities in Zambia,\" said Josh Goldman, KoBold's president. \"We just want a smooth path for deploying lots of capital.\"\n",
      "Zambia's president sees the investment as a sign of bigger things to come: \"It is important. When one investment comes, you are likely to get a second one,\" Hakainde Hichilema told The Wall Street Journal.\n",
      "U.S. officials have also highlighted that Chinese financing often comes with strings attached, such as using Chinese companies and Chinese-made materials. Ms. Harris alluded to the complications of taking money from Beijing during a news conference at the Ghanaian presidential palace Monday, referencing a need to \"ease the debt burden that is facing far too many countries,\" without mentioning China by name.\n",
      "Chinese lenders account for 12% of Africa's private and public external debt, according to a December 2022 Chatham House report. Ghana and Zambia, two countries that Ms. Harris is visiting, are both currently looking to Beijing for relief.\n",
      "\"We are concerned with what is happening on the globe as a whole, we are clear-eyed about that,\" Ms. Harris said when asked Monday in Accra about how much the rise of China figures into her trip. \"But this trip is motivated by the importance of the direct relationship between the United States and Ghana, and as I travel the continent, those countries.\"\n",

      "Full text: YouTube's chief executive said in an email that the company is looking into a claim by Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi that the Alphabet Inc. unit is suppressing his videos criticizing India's ruling party and a billionaire who controls a conglomerate accused of wide-ranging fraud .\n",
      "The March 25 email from YouTube's Neal Mohan, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, came in response to a letter sent two weeks earlier from the leader of a group of overseas Indians who support Mr. Gandhi's Congress party.\n",
      "The letter, which was reviewed by the Journal, included data from Mr. Gandhi's social-media team making the case that his videos related to \"the issue of cronyism of the ruling government with one industrialist, Mr. Gautam Adani,\" are receiving views that are significantly lower than YouTube analytics suggest they should be, and are being \"suppressed, perhaps unwittingly and algorithmically.\"\n",
      "The data, which was reviewed by the Journal, showed that based on interactions such as likes on two videos alleging Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given special treatment to the company headed by Mr. Adani, the Adani Group, the videos should have received about 2.8 million views combined, but instead got less than a third of that.\n",
      "The data also suggested Mr. Gandhi's videos are receiving fewer views because they are now recommended less frequently to users via YouTube's home page, the letter said.\n",
      "\"Thanks,\" Mr. Mohan wrote in reply. \"Team is taking a look,\" he wrote, without elaborating.\n",
      "Representatives for Alphabet Inc.'s Google and YouTube didn't respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "Representatives for the Prime Minister's Office, Mr. Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the Adani Group didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "Mr. Gandhi and other opposition parties have been pressing Mr. Modi's government to investigate allegations of stock-price manipulation and fraud involving the Adani Group, which had worked closely with the government in modernizing airports, ports and other infrastructure.\n",
      "U.S. short seller Hindenburg Research in January accused the energy and infrastructure conglomerate of improprieties such as using shell companies to manipulate its share prices. The Adani Group has denied the allegations .\n",
      "Google, like other U.S. tech titans, has been in New Delhi's crosshairs in recent years as Mr. Modi's government has tightened rules on foreign e-commerce players and moved to tamp down online dissent on platforms such as Twitter Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook.\n",
      "Google in January lost an appeal in India's Supreme Court to block an antitrust order that requires it to make significant changes to the way its Android operating system does business with smartphone makers, app developers and users.\n",
      "Mr. Mohan, previously YouTube's chief product officer, became head of YouTube in February after longtime chief executive Susan Wojcicki stepped down.\n",
      "Mr. Gandhi in 2021 wrote to Twitter Inc.'s chief executive alleging he was the victim of a government campaign to limit his ability to attract new followers on the platform. His account then began gaining new followers at a rapid clip.\n",
      "India's Parliament on Friday disqualified Mr. Gandhi as a lawmaker after a lower court convicted and sentenced him to two years in prison in a defamation case over remarks he made in a 2019 campaign speech referring to \"thieves\" as having the surname Modi.\n",
      "Mr. Gandhi's Congress party plans to appeal the conviction soon, according to party leaders. If the appeal is accepted, Mr. Gandhi would be able to retake his seat in the legislature.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTON -- Republicans and Democrats are sparring over measures in the $53 billion Chips Act that the Biden administration says are needed to ensure the measure's success, but which Republicans say are an effort to pursue liberal social policies.\n",
      "The Commerce Department has set rules for semiconductor companies seeking grants under the act that encourage the hiring of union workforces and economically disadvantaged individuals. Companies seeking more than $150 million must provide child care.\n",
      "A group of Republican senators including Ted Cruz of Texas and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee recently wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo saying the measures will make \"domestic chip production more expensive, less competitive, and reliant on taxpayer subsidies over private investment.\"\n",
      "In an interview, Ms. Raimondo pushed back on those claims. She said measures such as requiring chip makers to pay prevailing wages and provide child care are necessary to address a workforce shortage that could hinder efforts to expand semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. \"There is zero 'social policy' that we're trying to achieve here,\" Ms. Raimondo said.\n",
      "She added that the success of the Chips Act largely hinges on overcoming a labor shortage that could imperil plans to compete with China. \"We want them to show us a workforce plan, including how they think about child care, not because we have a social agenda but because we know [that] they're struggling to hire workers,\" Ms. Raimondo said.\n",
      "Ms. Raimondo joined President Biden in North Carolina on Tuesday for a visit to a semiconductor manufacturer in Durham that has plans to build a $5 billion chip-manufacturing plant projected to create 1,800 new jobs.\n",
      "During the visit, Mr. Biden said more than $435 billion in private sector manufacturing commitments have been made since he took office. A White House official said those investments would span at least the next decade and include more than $200 billion in clean energy, electric vehicle and battery investments, over $200 billion in semiconductors, and about $15 billion in biomanufacturing investments.\n",
      "Mr. Biden said the U.S. is \"determined to lead the world in the manufacturing of semiconductors.\" He also aimed at Republicans who have proposed cuts to government spending, saying doing so would cede \"the future of innovation and technology to China.\"\n",
      "In their letter, dated March 22, 14 Republican senators said that many of the rules the Biden administration has imposed on chip subsidy applicants weren't specified in the Chips Act. Their criticism echoed prior complaints from Republicans that conditions for companies applying for semiconductor funding are being used \"to pursue controversial policies that go beyond the requirements of the law.\"\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Kevin McCarthy tried to prod President Biden into starting talks over spending cuts as a condition for raising the debt ceiling, just as Republicans are struggling to unite around a blueprint for negotiations ahead of dual deadlines later this year.\n",
      "The White House released its own budget proposal earlier this month and has said it won't negotiate on spending until Republicans put forward their own plan. Mr. McCarthy has rejected that notion and said in a letter to Mr. Biden that talks should start as soon as possible.\n",
      "\"The budget has nothing to do with the debt ceiling,\" Mr. McCarthy told reporters.\n",
      "In his letter to Mr. Biden on Tuesday morning, the California Republican reiterated that he wanted to roll back nondefense discretionary spending and lock in low annual increases from there, while also proposing clawing back unspent Covid-19 relief funds and strengthening work requirements for social programs. He also called for measures to lower energy costs and secure the border, two priorities for House Republicans.\n",
      "The White House dismissed the letter, calling again for the House to pass a debt-ceiling increase with no spending cuts attached -- leaving any talks at an impasse. Mr. Biden has said the debt limit needed to be raised without conditions but has said he would engage in discussions over taxes and spending once Mr. McCarthy produces his budget plan. Many lawmakers expect the GOP budget to be completed in May or later.\n",
      "Mr. Biden responded in his own letter late Tuesday, telling Mr. McCarthy he looked forward to \"talking about our nation's economic and fiscal future\" separate from the debt ceiling. \"But for that conversation to be productive, we should both tell the American people what we are for,\" he said.\n",
      "The Treasury Department ran up against the roughly $31.4 trillion debt limit in January. It is now deploying a series of special accounting maneuvers to keep paying the government's obligations to bondholders, Social Security recipients and others. The U.S. could become unable to pay all of its bills as soon as this summer.\n",
      "House Republicans are struggling to unite behind a detailed plan on a GOP budget laying out their priorities, as well as a separate decision over what concessions to demand in return for voting to increase the debt ceiling.\n",

      "Full text: HOUSTON -- Wael Sawan knows he is about to make some people very unhappy.\n",
      "The new chief executive of Shell PLC is in the midst of crafting his business plan for the London-based energy giant, including whether to increase oil production. Doing so would please many investors looking to build on last year's oil-and-gas bonanza, which produced record annual earnings for Shell.\n",
      "But it almost certainly would generate howls of protest from environmentalists and other critics, including investors who want Shell to tackle climate-related goals more aggressively. Those investors argue a continued focus on fossil fuels endangers Shell's long-term prospects in a changing world.\n",
      "Mr. Sawan says he is committed to lowering the company's emissions and helping develop a new generation of clean-energy sources. But that is not where the bulk of profits are right now.\n",
      "\"I fundamentally believe in the role of oil and gas for a long, long time to come,\" he said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal.\n",
      "What's more, he said, he doesn't believe renewable- and low-carbon energy projects should be subsidized by Shell's fossil-fuel profits, but should deliver returns that merit continued investment on their own. \"We're definitely taking a hard look at the portfolio,\" Mr. Sawan said.\n",
      "All options are on the table, he said, including revising the company's 2021 forecast for an average 1% to 2% decrease in its crude output each year until 2030. Mr. Sawan also said he was weighingfurther exploration for new sources of oil and gas in areas where Shell doesn't currently operate.\n",
      "He cautioned that Shell's production targets and other key decisions are still being debated by its executives and board. Whatever he decides, Mr. Sawan expects to be unpopular among some groups, and maybe factions of all of them.\n",
      "\"I think the heat will come no matter what I do,\" he said.\n",
      "Shell has scheduled an update for investors on June 14.\n",
      "Finding the balance between fossil fuels and lower-carbon alternatives is a big challenge facing the CEOs of the biggest energy companies.\n",
      "The task is particularly acute for Mr. Sawan and Shell, Europe's biggest energy company, which moved to the U.K. after a Dutch court ruled in 2021 that it was partially responsible for climate change and must reduce its carbon emissions. Shell is appealing the ruling, arguing that it is being unreasonably singled out.\n",
      "In the U.K. and European continent, governments are clawing back portions of record profits earned last year by oil-and-gas companies as energy costs soared amid Russia's war in Ukraine.\n",
      "Less than a year ago, Shell's annual shareholder meeting in London was delayed by almost three hours by climate activists attending as shareholders, who glued themselves to chairs and chanted against the company's continued spending on fossil fuels.\n",
      "Mr. Sawan, who joined Shell in 1997 at the age of 22, now becomes its public face.\n",
      "Born in Lebanon, Mr. Sawan grew up mostly in Dubai and studied chemical engineering in Montreal. A dual Lebanese-Canadian national, Mr. Sawan is the first non-European CEO in Shell's history.\n",
      "Mr. Sawan is considered by colleagues inside and outside the company to be a technically adept manager, including in his most recent job overseeing Shell's massive liquefied natural-gas business, typically its biggest cash engine. He also took over responsibility for renewables on his final stretch toward the CEO job.\n",
      "In addition to Europe and the Middle East, he has worked on the U.S. Gulf Coast and run businesses including global deep-water operations and companywide oil-and-gas exploration and production, known as upstream. A pivotal time in his career, according to people who know him, came in 1999 when, after working his first couple of years in Oman, he considered leaving Shell to pursue his graduate business degree at Harvard University.\n",
      "Andy Brown, at the time his boss and later head of all upstream production for Shell, said he persuaded Mr. Sawan not to leave, but to get his M.B.A. with Shell's support and then afterward to return to the company.\n",
      "\"It was clear that Wael was a great talent,\" Mr. Brown said. \"When you're 24, it is about, is the guy smart and can he work through issues and problems?\" He said Mr. Sawan was especially skilled at developing relationships with business partners and government officials.\n",
      "Among the options under consideration is whether it might make sense for Shell to step up exploration for new oil-and-gas sources, Mr. Sawan said. That includes potentially looking far afield for new, untapped oil and gas sources in parts of the world known in the industry as \"frontiers\" because they lack production infrastructure that takes years, sometimes decades, to build into full production.\n",
      "Shell said two years ago it plans to end all new frontier exploration by the end of 2025.\n",
      "But oil demand is continuing to rise, and investors in global oil giants have rewarded companies -- including U.S. giants Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. -- for sticking with traditional fossil-fuel production.\n",
      "Shell says it is ahead of its schedule on planned annual 1% to 2% crude-output cuts, from divesting or running off assets more quickly than expected.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTONâ€”Republicans and Democrats are sparring over measures in the $53 billion Chips Act that the Biden administration says are needed to ensure the measure's success, but which Republicans say are an effort to pursue liberal social policies.\n",
      "The Commerce Department has set rules for semiconductor companies seeking grants under the act that encourage the hiring of union workforces and economically disadvantaged individuals. Companies seeking more than $150 million must provide child care.\n",
      "A group of Republican U.S. senators including Ted Cruz (R., Texas) and Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) recently wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo saying that the measures will make \"domestic chip production more expensive, less competitive, and reliant on taxpayer subsidies over private investment.\"\n",
      "In an interview, Ms. Raimondo pushed back on those claims. She said measures such as requiring chip makers to pay prevailing wages and provide child care are necessary to address a workforce shortage that could hinder efforts to expand semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.\n",
      "\"There is zero 'social policy' that we're trying to achieve here,\" Ms. Raimondo said. \"We have no desire to put requirements on companies that are bad for the companies.\"\n",
      "She added that the success of the Chips Act largely hinges on overcoming a labor shortage that could imperil plans to compete with China by boosting domestic chip production at home.\n",
      "\"We want them to show us a workforce plan, including how they think about child care, not because we have a social agenda but because we know [that] they're struggling to hire workers,\" Ms. Raimondo said. \"We do need to protect taxpayer money and make sure the projects get done successfully, on time and on budget.\"\n",
      "Ms. Raimondo joined President Biden in North Carolina on Tuesday for a visit to a semiconductor manufacturer in Durham that has plans to build a $5 billion chip-manufacturing plant projected to create 1,800 new jobs.\n",
      "During the visit, Mr. Biden said that more than $435 billion in private-sector manufacturing commitments have been made since he took office. A White House official said those investments would span at least the next decade and include more than $200 billion in clean energy, electric vehicle and battery investments, over $200 billion in semiconductors, and about $15 billion in biomanufacturing investments.\n",
      "The event kicked off a three-week tour that will see Mr. Biden and other top administration officials visit key battleground states to tout legislative accomplishments as the president gears up for a likely re-election campaign where the impact of his domestic economic policies is expected to be a core theme.\n",
      "Mr. Biden said the U.S. is \"determined to lead the world in the manufacturing of semiconductors.\" He also took aim at Republicans who have proposed cuts to government spending, arguing that doing so \"would mean ceding the future of innovation and technology to China.\" He added, \"We're not going to let them undo all the progress we made.\"\n",
      "Mr. Biden's approval rating neared the lowest point of his presidency in a new poll while another recent survey found most Americans think the president has accomplished \"not very much\" or \"little or nothing\" during his tenure.\n",
      "Mr. Biden and his administration are now ramping up efforts to sell the impact of its policies as the president begins making the case for a second term, although he has yet to formally launch his re-election campaign.\n",
      "In their letter, dated March 22, the 14 Republican senators said that many of the rules the Biden administration has imposed on chip subsidy applicants weren't specified in the Chips Act. Their criticism echoed prior complaints from Republicans that conditions for companies applying for the first round of semiconductor funding are being used \"as a tool to pursue controversial policies that go beyond the requirements of the law.\"\n",
      "This includes sharing profit that exceed projections with the government and favoring applicants who commit to pursuing \"environmental justice\" measures.\n",
      "The Republicans said the Commerce Department's criteria will add to companies' costs for building facilities and making the U.S. less competitive against other manufacturing nations.\n",
      "Ms. Raimondo said preferences added by the department on child care and workforce development are aimed at speeding up the launch of the projects amid the shortage of workers. She said that the department will take a holistic approach and negotiate terms of the agreement flexibly with individual companies as it applies the criteria stated in the application materials.\n",
      "She added that the department's primary goal is to get the projects up and running quickly and efficiently, and that the request to submit plans is to make sure the projects are built on time and on budget and staffed effectively.\n",
      "\"The way you're going to meet your workforce needs in rural Idaho is different than in Texas or New York,\" she said. \"We're not going to predetermine the way they fulfill these projects.\"\n",
      "The Chips Act passed Congress with bipartisan support last year, marking another bipartisan achievement for Mr. Biden after the passage of the $1 trillion infrastructure law in November 2021. In the Senate, 17 Republicans joined a nearly unanimous Democratic caucus in favor of the bill, while two dozen Republicans crossed party lines to help pass it in the House.\n",
      "Ms. Raimondo lobbied both Democrats and Republicans amid negotiations around the legislation, with an emphasis on the national-security concerns of continuing to rely on Taiwan or U.S. adversaries for semiconductors.\n",
      "Companies building leading-edge chip factories in the U.S. can begin applying for the Chips Act funds Friday. The application process for companies looking to build current generation and mature technology facilities opens June 26.\n",

      "\n",
      "Full text: The U.S. and China have described Taiwan as the most volatile flashpoint in their increasingly fraught bilateral relations.\n",
      "Now, after months of sparring by Washington and Beijing over the Ukraine war, a suspected surveillance balloon , TikTok and other issues, Taiwan is set to return to the center of great power tensions, with the island's leader traveling to the U.S.\n",
      "Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen is stopping in New York and Los Angeles on her way to and from Central America, with plans to meet House Speaker Kevin McCarthy next week in California. Some in the Biden administration are concerned that the visit will give Beijing the pretext to conduct military exercises near the island , as it did last summer, or erode Taiwan's security in other ways, according to officials.\n",
      "As Ms. Tsai's arrival in New York on Wednesday approaches, U.S. officials have been sounding out Ms. Tsai's government to ensure her trip stays within past norms, while also urging Beijing against reacting strongly , the officials and people familiar with the talks said.\n",
      "Visits by Taiwanese presidents to the U.S. are always carefully managed affairs, with Washington trying to give the island's leaders a way to show that their government has U.S. support, without giving Beijing an opening for forceful retaliation.\n",
      "How the three governments handle the visit is likely to determine whether Washington- Beijing relations deteriorate further. All three are readying their militaries for a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is a longstanding U.S. partner that Beijing regards as its territory, and domestic politics make compromise difficult for each.\n",
      "\"There is a possibility that the transit, if not carefully handled, could blow up in everybody's face,\" said Bonnie Glaser, who heads the Indo-Pacific program at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S. \"It could end up with a major display of military force by the Chinese, which will introduce even more friction into the U.S.-China relationship,\" she said.\n",
      "China, which stated its displeasure at Ms. Tsai's trip, opened formal diplomatic relations over the weekend with Honduras , which cut its decades-old ties with Taiwan. Ms. Tsai's trip takes her to two of Taiwan's 13 remaining diplomatic partners, Guatemala and Belize, neighbors of Honduras.\n",
      "Ms. Tsai's stops in the U.S. are officially called \"transit\" visitsâ€”language that is part of the delicate diplomacy meant to maintain a U.S.-China-Taiwan equilibrium . Taiwanese presidents have made dozens of such visits over the years, including several by Ms. Tsai, with minimal pushback from Beijing , Biden administration officials said.\n",
      "\"There is no reason for Beijing to turn this transit, which is consistent with longstanding U.S. policy, into something it is not or use it to overreact,\" the State Department said.\n",
      "But China carefully scrutinizes the visits for signs that the U.S. and Taiwan are testing the limits of Beijing's tolerance, and Taiwan's leaders at times have pushed the envelope to try to show their influence in the U.S. House Speaker McCarthy would be the highest-level U.S. politician to meet a Taiwan president on American soil since the transit visits started.\n",
      "Ties now between Taiwan and the U.S. are more robust than at any time since Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, according to officials and political analysts, with more communication among defense officials and higher-level contacts between the governments. That closeness puts immense pressure on Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who has said the Taiwan issue should not be passed from generation to generation.\n",
      "Beijing has put off U.S. requests earlier this month for Mr. Xi and President Biden to speak by phone in an effort by the administration to settle some of the recent rancor. Beijing wants to wait to see how Ms. Tsai's visit plays out before agreeing to any leader-level call, Chinese officials said.\n",
      "\"We strongly oppose any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, strongly oppose any U.S. visit by the leader of the Taiwan authorities regardless of the rationale or pretext,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters last week. \"The reported trip is not so much a 'transit,' but an attempt to seek breakthroughs and propagate 'Taiwan independence.'\"\n",
      "A successful trip would help Ms. Tsai show that her party can manage close relations with the U.S. without provoking a harsh response from Beijing. That would boost her current vice president's chances of winning a pivotal election to succeed her early next year when her two terms as president end.\n",
      "\"China has been ramping up its aggressive behavior and this is a general concern,\" said Kolas Yotaka, a spokeswoman for Ms. Tsai. \"We think the best response is deeper cooperation with our partners to safeguard peace in the region and protect our common democratic values.\"\n",
      "This week, Ms. Tsai's predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, began a 12-day tour of China, the first former president of Taiwan to set foot in the mainland since 1949. Ms. Tsai's office has sought to play down the China trip by Mr. Ma, who favored closer ties with Beijing when he was president between 2008 and 2016.\n",
      "Some lawmakers from Mr. Ma's party, the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, and members of the public have voiced concern that the island might be dragged into war as part of U.S.-China rivalry. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, along with Beijing's stepped-up military pressure on Taiwan, has created a sense of urgency within Ms. Tsai's government and the U.S. about the need to harden Taiwan for eventual conflict .\n",
      "Early this year, Washington and Beijing seemed poised for detente. Tensions had subsided from their last bout of friction over Taiwan: then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island in August . Then, the U.S. detected the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon crossing North America and delayed high-level talks with Beijing before shooting down the craft, further angering Chinese leadership.\n",
      "Both sides have drawn sharper lines over the war in Ukraine, with Mr. Xi holding a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week. Beijing, which has bolstered Moscow by buying energy and boosting trade, has tried to position itself as a potential peacemaker and portrayed the U.S. as irresponsible for arming Kyiv.\n",
      "One concern for the administration is a closed-door reception on Thursday in New York by the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, to award Ms. Tsai its global leadership award. A current fellow at the institute is Mike Pompeo, the former Trump administration secretary of state who, while visiting Taiwan last year, urged in a Facebook post that the U.S. grant formal diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.\n",
      "The Biden administration has said U.S. policy remains unchanged. A move to formal recognition of Taiwan would likely be seen by Beijing as a reneging on four decades of U.S. diplomatic commitments and potentially cross a red line China has set out for triggering military action.\n",
      "Hudson said Mr. Pompeo isn't attending. The think tank declined to release a list of invitees and other details of the event.\n",
      "On her way back from visiting Guatemala and Belize, Ms. Tsai is due to meet at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library with House Speaker McCarthy. Other Republican members of Congress, including Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, who leads a special committee on U.S. competition with China's Communist Party, are expected to attend.\n",
      "Taiwan's foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said last week that Ms. Tsai would also meet with members of the Democratic Party.\n",
      "In Taipei, government and ruling party officials are concerned that any misstep during Ms. Tsai's trip might put further strain on its troubled relationship with Beijingâ€”or mar relations with Washington.\n",
      "Some lawmakers in the opposition Kuomintang, along with pro-opposition media and a number of academics, have suggested that the U.S. is treating Taiwan like a pawn in its competition with Beijing. Some pointed to chipmaking powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s decision to build a $40 billion facto ry in Arizona, saying it amounts to forced technology transfer that primarily benefits the U.S.\n",
      "\"The Americans are our good friends and have helped us so much over the past several decades, but I remain skeptical,\" Kuomintang lawmaker Wu Sz-huai said during an appearance by Taiwan's foreign minister before the legislature last week. \"They put their own national interests first, not Taiwan's national interests.\"\n",
      "Taiwan's government has characterized some of the criticisms as misinformation designed to weaken ties between Washington and Taipei and predicted such attacks would intensify ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTONâ€”House Speaker Kevin McCarthy tried to prod President Biden into starting talks over spending cuts as a condition for raising the debt ceiling , just as Republicans are struggling to unite around a blueprint for negotiations ahead of dual deadlines later this year.\n",
      "The White House released its own budget proposal earlier this month and has said it won't negotiate on spending until Republicans put forward their own plan. Mr. McCarthy has rejected that notion and said in a letter to Mr. Biden that talks should start as soon as possible. While neither budget would have a chance of becoming law, they serve to outline the parties' policy intentions.\n",
      "\"The budget has nothing to do with the debt ceiling,\" Mr. McCarthy told reporters . \"Let's get the debt ceiling done and stop playing games.\"\n",
      "In his letter to Mr. Biden on Tuesday morning, the California Republican reiterated that he wanted to roll back nondefense discretionary spending and lock in low annual increases from there, while also proposing clawing back unspent Covid-19 relief funds and strengthening work requirements for social programs. He also called for measures to lower energy costs and secure the border, two priorities for House Republicans.\n",
      "The White House dismissed the letter, calling again for the House to pass a debt ceiling increase with no spending cuts attachedâ€”leaving any talks at an impasse. Mr. Biden has said the debt limit needed to be raised without conditions but has said he would engage in discussions over taxes and spending once Mr. McCarthy produces his budget plan. Many lawmakers expect the GOP budget to be completed in May or later.\n",
      "Mr. Biden responded in his own letter late Tuesday, telling Mr. McCarthy he looked forward to \"talking about our nation's economic and fiscal future\" separate from the debt ceiling. \"But for that conversation to be productive, we should both tell the American people what we are for,\" he said.\n",
      "The Treasury Departmen t ran up against the roughly $31.4 trillion debt limit in January. It is now deploying a series of special accounting maneuvers to keep paying the government's obligations to bondholders, Social Security recipients and others. The U.S. could become unable to pay all of its bills as soon as this summer.\n",
      "\"At the moment, I don't see how we get there,\" Rep. Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.) chairman of the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said at a Punchbowl News event on Tuesday regarding a path to raising the debt ceiling. \"And this is a marked change from where I've been,\" he said, noting the lack of conversations with the White House.\n",
      "House Republicans are struggling to unite behind a detailed plan on a GOP budget laying out their priorities, as well as a separate decision over what concessions to demand in return for voting to increase the debt ceiling.\n",
      "The lack of a clear path forward has become conspicuous in recent weeks. After Rep. Jodey Arrington (R., Texas), the House Budget Committee chair, said that he was completing a list of demands for debt-ceiling talks and spending cuts, Mr. McCarthy flatly told reporters last week: \"I have no idea what he is talking about.\"\n",
      "\"My focus is on the budget resolution, his focus is on the debt ceiling,\" Mr. Arrington said in an interview on Tuesday. Asked about how the two would intersect, he said the debt-ceiling proposal might need to readied before a budget resolution, which would include a longer list of spending cuts across numerous government programs and open Republicans up to political attacks.\n",
      "Still, Mr. Arrington said he was directing his efforts at getting a budget passed with support of Republicans. \"I have to herd the butterflies to a 218 threshold,\" he said.\n",
      "Many Republicans aren't certain that they can reach an agreement. With a thin 222-213 majority in the House, Mr. McCarthy must keep almost every Republican on board, both centrists and conservatives, assuming all Democrats oppose their plan.\n",
      "\"It's a complicated thingâ€¦there are 222 individuals,\" said Rep. Thomas Massie (R., Ky.) of his party's members agreeing to spending cuts. \"I would like to as soon as possible get 218 people around an idea, even if it's aspirational,\" he said.\n",
      "Some Republicans say that they see the debt-ceiling increase debate colliding with the fiscal year-end government spending deadline in September, which could threaten a government shutdown at the same time as the nation teeters on the edge of default.\n",
      "Republicans have maintained they will pass a budget that aims to eliminate the deficit after 10 years, fulfilling a pledge Mr. McCarthy made to win over holdouts during his speaker election in January.\n",
      "With cuts to Medicare and Social Security off the table, such a plan would require deep reductions in other parts of the federal budget. A recent Congressional Budget Office analysis found that balancing the budget in 10 years would require 86% reductions in domestic programs if Medicare and Social Security as well as military and veterans spending were off the table.\n",
      "\"A lot of my colleagues who campaign and talk about cutting all the out-of-control spending in Washington and then when we get opportunities to cut it seem to get a little lighthearted and sometimes seem to lack the backbone,\" Rep. Eli Crane (R., Ariz.) said. \"That's really disappointing.\"\n",
      "Complicating matters, groups of House Republicans are also expected to release their own budget plans, separate from the leadership-negotiated one.\n",
      "\"I don't know that his budget has any bearing really on ours,\" said Oklahoma Rep. Kevin Hern, the chair of the Republican Study Committee, the largest Republican caucus, referring to Mr. McCarthy's spending plan. He expects his caucus to release a budget in mid-April.\n",
      "The House Freedom Caucus, about three dozen lawmakers who represent the Republicans' most conservative wing, praised Mr. McCarthy's letter and introduced as legislation a list of discretionary spending cuts that they said would total $1 trillion.\n",

      "Full text: The U.S. and China have described Taiwan as the most volatile flashpoint in their increasingly fraught bilateral relations.\n",
      "Now, after months of sparring by Washington and Beijing over the Ukraine war, a suspected surveillance balloon , TikTok and other issues, Taiwan is set to return to the center of great power tensions, with the island's leader traveling to the U.S.\n",
      "Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen is stopping in New York and Los Angeles on her way to and from Central America, with plans to meet House Speaker Kevin McCarthy next week in California. Some in the Biden administration are concerned that the visit will give Beijing the pretext to conduct military exercises near the island , as it did last summer, or erode Taiwan's security in other ways, according to officials.\n",
      "As Ms. Tsai's arrival in New York on Wednesday approaches, U.S. officials have been sounding out Ms. Tsai's government to ensure her trip stays within past norms, while also urging Beijing against reacting strongly , the officials and people familiar with the talks said.\n",
      "Visits by Taiwanese presidents to the U.S. are always carefully managed affairs, with Washington trying to give the island's leaders a way to show their government has U.S. support, without giving Beijing an opening for forceful retaliation.\n",
      "How the three governments handle the visit is likely to determine whether Washington- Beijing relations deteriorate further. All three are readying their militaries for a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is a longstanding U.S. partner that Beijing regards as its territory, and domestic politics make compromise difficult for each.\n",
      "\"There is a possibility that the transit, if not carefully handled, could blow up in everybody's face,\" said Bonnie Glaser, who heads the Indo-Pacific program at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S. \"It could end up with a major display of military force by the Chinese, which will introduce even more friction into the U.S.-China relationship,\" she said.\n",
      "China, which stated its displeasure at Ms. Tsai's trip, opened formal diplomatic relations over the weekend with Honduras , which cut its decades-old ties with Taiwan. Ms. Tsai's trip takes her to two of Taiwan's 13 remaining diplomatic partners, Guatemala and Belize, neighbors of Honduras.\n",
      "Ms. Tsai's stops in the U.S. are officially called \"transit\" visitsâ€”language that is part of the delicate diplomacy meant to maintain a U.S.-China-Taiwan equilibrium . Taiwanese presidents have made dozens of such visits over the years, including several by Ms. Tsai, with, Biden administration officials said, minimal pushback from Beijing .\n",
      "\"There is no reason for Beijing to turn this transit, which is consistent with longstanding U.S. policy, into something it is not or use it to overreact,\" the State Department said.\n",
      "But China carefully scrutinizes the visits for signs that the U.S. and Taiwan are testing the limits of Beijing's tolerance, and Taiwan's leaders at times have pushed the envelope to try to show their influence in the U.S. House Speaker McCarthy would be the highest-level U.S. politician to meet a Taiwan president on American soil since the transit visits started.\n",
      "Ties now between Taiwan and the U.S. are more robust than at any time since Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, according to officials and political analysts, with more communication among defense officials and higher-level contacts between the governments. That closeness puts immense pressure on Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who has said China's goal of taking control of Taiwan should not be left to the next generation.\n",
      "Beijing has put off U.S. requests earlier this month for Mr. Xi and President Biden to speak by phone in an effort by the administration to settle some of the recent rancor. Beijing wants to wait to see how Ms. Tsai's visit plays out before agreeing to any leader-level call, Chinese officials said.\n",
      "\"We strongly oppose any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, strongly oppose any U.S. visit by the leader of the Taiwan authorities regardless of the rationale or pretext,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters last week. \"The reported trip is not so much a 'transit,' but an attempt to seek breakthroughs and propagate 'Taiwan independence.'\"\n",
      "A successful trip would help Ms. Tsai show that her party can manage close relations with the U.S. without provoking a harsh response from Beijing. That would boost her current vice president's chances of winning a pivotal election to succeed her early next year when her two terms as president end.\n",
      "\"China has been ramping up its aggressive behavior and this is a general concern,\" said Kolas Yotaka, a spokeswoman for Ms. Tsai. \"We think the best response is deeper cooperation with our partners to safeguard peace in the region and protect our common democratic values.\"\n",
      "This week, Ms. Tsai's predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, began a 12-day tour of China, the first former president of Taiwan to set foot in the mainland since 1949. Ms. Tsai's office has sought to play down the China trip by Mr. Ma, who favored closer ties with Beijing when he was president between 2008 and 2016.\n",
      "Some lawmakers from Mr. Ma's party, the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, and members of the public have voiced concern that the island might be dragged into war as part of U.S.-China rivalry. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, along with Beijing's stepped-up military pressure on Taiwan, has created a sense of urgency within Ms. Tsai's government and the U.S. about the need to harden Taiwan for eventual conflict .\n",
      "Early this year, Washington and Beijing seemed poised for detente. Tensions had subsided from their last bout of friction over Taiwan: then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island in August . Then, the U.S. detected the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon crossing North America and delayed high-level talks with Beijing before shooting down the craft, further angering the Chinese leadership.\n",
      "Both sides have drawn sharper lines over the war in Ukraine, with Mr. Xi holding a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week. Beijing, which has bolstered Moscow by buying energy and boosting trade, has tried to position itself as a potential peacemaker and portrayed the U.S. as irresponsible for arming Kyiv.\n",
      "One concern for the administration is a closed-door reception on Thursday in New York by the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, to award Ms. Tsai its global leadership award. A current fellow at the institute is Mike Pompeo, the former Trump administration secretary of state who, while visiting Taiwan last year, urged in a Facebook post that the U.S. grant formal diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.\n",
      "The Biden administration has said U.S. policy remains unchanged. A move to formal recognition of Taiwan would likely be seen by Beijing as a reneging on four decades of U.S. diplomatic commitments and potentially cross a red line China has set out for triggering military action.\n",
      "The think tank declined to release a list of invitees and other details of the event. A spokesman for Mr. Pompeo didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "On her way back from visiting Guatemala and Belize, Ms. Tsai is due to meet at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library with House Speaker McCarthy. Other Republican members of Congress, including Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, who leads a special committee on U.S. competition with China's Communist Party, are expected to attend.\n",
      "Taiwan's foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said last week that Ms. Tsai would also meet with members of the Democratic Party.\n",
      "In Taipei, government and ruling party officials are concerned that any misstep during Ms. Tsai's trip may put further strain on its troubled relationship with Beijingâ€”or mar relations with Washington.\n",
      "Some lawmakers in the opposition Kuomintang, along with pro-opposition media and a number of academics, have suggested that the U.S. is treating Taiwan like a pawn in its competition with Beijing. Some pointed to chipmaking powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s decision to build a $40 billion facto ry in Arizona, saying it amounts to forced technology transfer that primarily benefits the U.S.\n",
      "\"The Americans are our good friends and have helped us so much over the past several decades, but I remain skeptical,\" Kuomintang lawmaker Wu Sz-huai said during an appearance by Taiwan's foreign minister before the legislature last week. \"They put their own national interests first, not Taiwan's national interests.\"\n",
      "Taiwan's government has characterized some of the criticisms as misinformation designed to weaken ties between Washington and Taipei and predicted such attacks would intensify ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n",

      "\n",
      "Full text: HOUSTONâ€”Wael Sawan knows he is about to make some people very unhappy.\n",
      "The new chief executive of Shell PLC is in the midst of crafting his business plan for the London-based energy giant, including whether to increase oil production. Doing so would please many investors looking to build on last year's oil-and-gas bonanza, which produced record annual earnings for Shell.\n",
      "But it almost certainly would generate howls of protest from environmentalists and other critics, including investors who want Shell to tackle climate-related goals more aggressively. Those investors argue a continued focus on fossil fuels endangers Shell's long-term prospects in a changing world.\n",
      "Mr. Sawan says he is committed to lowering the company's emissions and helping develop a new generation of clean-energy sources. But that is not where the bulk of profits are right now.\n",
      "\"I fundamentally believe in the role of oil and gas for a long, long time to come,\" he said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal.\n",
      "What's more, he said, he doesn't believe renewable- and low-carbon energy projects should be subsidized by Shell's fossil-fuel profits, but should deliver returns that merit continued investment on their own. \"We're definitely taking a hard look at the portfolio,\" Mr. Sawan said.\n",
      "All options are on the table , he said, including revising the company's 2021 forecast for an average 1% to 2% decrease in its crude output each year until 2030. Mr. Sawan also said he was weighing further exploration for new sources of oil and gas in areas where Shell doesn't currently operate.\n",
      "He cautioned that Shell's production targets and other key decisions are still being debated by its executives and board. Whatever he decides, Mr. Sawan expects to be unpopular among some groups, and maybe factions of all of them.\n",
      "\"I think the heat will come no matter what I do,\" he said.\n",
      "Shell has scheduled an update for investors on June 14 in New York.\n",
      "Finding the balance between fossil fuels and lower-carbon alternatives is a big challenge facing the CEOs of the biggest energy companies .\n",
      "The task is particularly acute for Mr. Sawan and Shell, Europe's biggest energy company, which moved to the U.K. after a Dutch court ruled in 2021 that it was partially responsible for climate change and must reduce its carbon emissions. Shell is appealing the ruling, arguing that it is being unreasonably singled out.\n",
      "In the U.K. and European continent, governments are clawing back portions of record profits earned last year by oil-and-gas companies as energy costs soared amid Russia's war in Ukraine.\n",
      "Less than a year ago, Shell's annual shareholder meeting in London was delayed by almost three hours by climate activists attending as shareholders, who glued themselves to chairs and chanted against the company's continued spending on fossil fuels.\n",
      "Mr. Sawan, who joined Shell in 1997 at the age of 22, now becomes its public face .\n",
      "Born in Lebanon, Mr. Sawan grew up mostly in Dubai and studied chemical engineering in Montreal. A dual Lebanese-Canadian national, Mr. Sawan is the first non-European CEO in Shell's history.\n",
      "Mr. Sawan is considered by colleagues inside and outside the company to be a technically adept manager, including in his most recent job overseeing Shell's massive liquefied natural gas business, typically its biggest cash engine. He also took over responsibility for renewables on his final stretch toward the CEO job.\n",
      "Wael Sawan is Shell's first non-European CEO. PHOTO: Mary Turner for The Wall Street Journal\n",
      "In addition to Europe and the Middle East, he has worked on the U.S. Gulf Coast and run businesses including global deep-water operations and companywide oil-and-gas exploration and production, known as upstream. A pivotal time in his career, according to people who know him, came in 1999 when, after working his first couple of years in Oman, he scored highly on the business-school entrance exam and considered leaving Shell to pursue his graduate business degree at Harvard University.\n",
      "Andy Brown, at the time his boss and later head of all upstream production for Shell, said he persuaded Mr. Sawan not to leave, but to get his M.B.A. with Shell's support and then afterward to return to the company. He later followed in Mr. Brown's footsteps in the Middle East overseeing Shell's Qatar operations.\n",
      "\"It was clear that Wael was a great talent,\" Mr. Brown said. \"When you're 24, it is about, is the guy smart and can he work through issues and problems?\" He said Mr. Sawan was especially skilled at developing relationships with business partners and government officials.\n",
      "That proved a valuable asset as Mr. Sawan traveled the world, people who know him said. He could defuse tensions by connecting with government leaders and executives over a shared love of soccer, or regional food, they said.\n",
      "In Qatar, Mr. Sawan helped steer a huge natural-gas refinery development project through cost hurdles and delays, earning internal recognition for his diplomacy with government officials and other partners, people involved in the project say.\n",
      "People close to Mr. Sawan said they expect him to be tested at the helm, not just by navigating Shell's business challenges but also by what they describe as his natural reluctance to confide in fellow executives, as well as the time he'll be separated from his wife and sons. Since getting the top job last year, Mr. Sawan has spent time consulting with business heads but also periods in near-isolation working through details of businesses in preparation for a full review, people familiar with his schedule said.\n",
      "\"It's a massively intense job, and you sort of need to build the stamina for it,\" Mr. Sawan said. \"I'm trying to stick to my gym patterns, my eating patterns, to make sure that you stay sane at the end of it and still enjoy life after it.\"\n",
      "Among the options under consideration is whether it might make sense for Shell to step up exploration for new oil-and-gas sources, Mr. Sawan said. That includes potentially looking far afield for new, untapped oil and gas sources in parts of the world known in the industry as \"frontiers\" because they lack production infrastructure that takes years, sometimes decades, to build into full production.\n",
      "A Shell oil platform at a shipyard in Corpus Christi, Texas. PHOTO: Christopher Lee for The Wall Street Journal\n",
      "Shell said two years ago it plans to end all new frontier exploration by the end of 2025, giving the company a finite window to search for virgin reservoirs of oil and gas where it isn't already operating.\n",
      "Dwindling options for limiting global warming call for a massive and rapid shift away from fossil fuels, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report last week .\n",
      "At the same time, oil demand is continuing to rise, and investors in global oil giants have rewarded companiesâ€”including U.S. giants Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp.â€” for sticking with traditional fossil-fuel production.\n",
      "Shell says it is ahead of its schedule on planned annual 1% to 2% crude-output cuts, from divesting or running off assets more quickly than expected.\n",
      "\"We're almost at the point where we had expected to be by 2030,\" Mr. Sawan said. \"That gives us options to be able to choose how we want to go from here. It's those options that we're assessing.\"\n",
      "To illustrate what he considers a smart approach to new-energy projects, he noted Shell's decisionâ€”overseen by himâ€”to build what the company expects to be Europe's largest renewable hydrogen plant, in Rotterdam, once it is up and running in 2025.\n",
      "\"There's a great opportunity for that to be a double-digit return,\" Mr. Sawan said. \"Let's prove the concept. If we can prove the concept, then maybe the second one will be built and the third one, but it has to be done in a measured way.\"\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTONâ€”Republicans and Democrats are sparring over measures in the $53 billion Chips Act that the Biden administration says are needed to ensure the measure's success, but which Republicans say are an effort to pursue liberal social policies.\n",
      "The Commerce Department has set rules for semiconductor companies seeking grants under the act that encourage the hiring of union workforces and economically disadvantaged individuals. Companies seeking more than $150 million must provide child care.\n",
      "A group of Republican U.S. senators including Ted Cruz (R., Texas) and Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) recently wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo saying that the measures will make \"domestic chip production more expensive, less competitive, and reliant on taxpayer subsidies over private investment.\"\n",
      "In an interview, Ms. Raimondo pushed back on those claims. She said measures such as requiring chip makers to pay prevailing wages and provide child care are necessary to address a workforce shortage that could hinder efforts to expand semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.\n",
      "\"There is zero 'social policy' that we're trying to achieve here,\" Ms. Raimondo said. \"We have no desire to put requirements on companies that are bad for the companies.\"\n",
      "She added that the success of the Chips Act largely hinges on overcoming a labor shortage that could imperil plans to compete with China by boosting domestic chip production at home.\n",
      "\"We want them to show us a workforce plan, including how they think about child care, not because we have a social agenda but because we know [that] they're struggling to hire workers,\" Ms. Raimondo said. \"We do need to protect taxpayer money and make sure the projects get done successfully, on time and on budget.\"\n",
      "Ms. Raimondo is expected to join President Biden in North Carolina on Tuesday for a visit to a semiconductor manufacturer in Durham that has plans to build a $5 billion chip-manufacturing plant projected to create 1,800 new jobs.\n",
      "During the visit, Mr. Biden will say that more than $435 billion in private-sector manufacturing commitments have been made since he took office, according to a White House official, who didn't specify a time frame for when the investments would be made. The total includes more than $200 billion in clean energy, electric vehicle and battery investments, over $200 billion in semiconductors, and about $15 billion in biomanufacturing investments.\n",
      "The event will kick off a three-week tour that will see Mr. Biden and other top administration officials visit key battleground states to tout legislative accomplishments as the president gears up for a likely re-election campaign where the impact of his domestic economic policies is expected to be a core theme.\n",
      "Mr. Biden's approval rating neared the lowest point of his presidency in a new poll while another recent survey found most Americans think the president has accomplished \"not very much\" or \"little or nothing\" during his tenure.\n",
      "Mr. Biden and his administration are now ramping up efforts to sell the impact of its policies as the president begins making the case for a second term, although he has yet to formally launch his re-election campaign.\n",
      "In their letter, dated March 22, the 14 Republican senators said that many of the rules the Biden administration has imposed on chip subsidy applicants weren't specified in the Chips Act. Their criticism echoed prior complaints from Republicans that conditions for companies applying for the first round of semiconductor funding are being used \"as a tool to pursue controversial policies that go beyond the requirements of the law.\"\n",
      "This includes sharing profit that exceed projections with the government and favoring applicants who commit to pursuing \"environmental justice\" measures.\n",
      "The Republicans said the Commerce Department's criteria will add to companies' costs for building facilities and making the U.S. less competitive against other manufacturing nations.\n",
      "Ms. Raimondo said preferences added by the department on child care and workforce development are aimed at speeding up the launch of the projects amid the shortage of workers. She said that the department will take a holistic approach and negotiate terms of the agreement flexibly with individual companies as it applies the criteria stated in the application materials.\n",
      "She added that the department's primary goal is to get the projects up and running quickly and efficiently, and that the request to submit plans is to make sure the projects are built on time and on budget and staffed effectively.\n",
      "\"The way you're going to meet your workforce needs in rural Idaho is different than in Texas or New York,\" she said. \"We're not going to predetermine the way they fulfill these projects.\"\n",
      "The Chips Act passed Congress with bipartisan support last year, marking another bipartisan achievement for Mr. Biden after the passage of the $1 trillion infrastructure law in November 2021. In the Senate, 17 Republicans joined a nearly unanimous Democratic caucus in favor of the bill, while two dozen Republicans crossed party lines to help pass it in the House.\n",
      "Ms. Raimondo lobbied both Democrats and Republicans amid negotiations around the legislation, with an emphasis on the national-security concerns of continuing to rely on Taiwan or U.S. adversaries for semiconductors.\n",
      "Companies building leading-edge chip factories in the U.S. can begin applying for the Chips Act funds Friday. The application process for companies looking to build current generation and mature technology facilities opens June 26.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Japan reached a trade agreement for minerals used in clean-energy technologies, a deal aimed at allowing Japan to meet sourcing requirements for new electric-vehicle subsidies in the U.S. and shifting energy supply chains away from China.\n",
      "Under the deal, the U.S. and Japan agreed not to levy export duties on critical minerals they trade and coordinate labor standards in producing minerals, among other steps, according to a U.S. announcement. The pact builds on a limited trade accord the two countries reached in 2019, and they will review the minerals deal every two years to see if they should end or change it.\n",
      "The Biden administration has started pursuing trade deals with close allies on critical minerals as it tries to address two problems: restrictions it has placed on new subsidies for electric vehicles and China's current dominance of the supply of minerals such as lithium and graphite that are necessary for making electric vehicles.\n",
      "The Inflation Reduction Act overhauled a tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles. Among the new requirements for qualifying for the full $7,500 credit is that much of the minerals in a vehicle's battery must come from the U.S. or a country with a free-trade agreement with the U.S.\n",
      "Many U.S. allies, including Japan, the European Union and U.K., don't have traditional free-trade pacts with the U.S.\n",
      "Biden administration officials crafted the deal with Tokyo in such a way that minerals from Japan will now meet the sourcing requirement for the new subsidy -- while not having to launch lengthy, politically difficult negotiations over broader trading issues.\n",

      "The Biden administration has started pursuing trade deals with close allies on critical minerals as it tries to address two problems: restrictions it has placed on new subsidies for electric vehicles and China's current dominance of the supply of minerals such as lithium and graphite that are necessary for making electric vehicles.\n",
      "The Inflation Reduction Actâ€”the broad climate, healthcare and tax package Congress passed last yearâ€”overhauled a tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles. Among the new requirements for qualifying for the full $7,500 credit is that much of the minerals in a vehicle's battery must come from the U.S. or a country with a free-trade agreement with the U.S.\n",
      "Many close U.S. allies, including Japan, the European Union and U.K., don't have traditional free-trade agreements with the U.S.\n",
      "Biden administration officials crafted the deal with Tokyo in such a way that minerals from Japan will now meet the sourcing requirement for the new subsidyâ€”while not having to launch lengthy, politically difficult negotiations over broader trading issues. The U.S. is negotiating a similar trade agreement with the EU focused on critical minerals, with plans to also try and strike a deal with the U.K.\n",
      "\"This is a welcome moment as the United States continues to work with our allies and partners to strengthen supply chains for critical minerals, including through the Inflation Reduction Act,\" U.S. Trade Rep. Katherine Tai said. The U.S. and Japan are expected to sign the agreement Tuesday, when it will go into effect.\n",
      "Ms. Tai's Japanese counterpart, trade minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, also welcomed the deal, saying minerals such as lithium, cobalt and nickel are important because of rising demand for EV batteries.\n",
      "With the subsidies, the U.S. is trying to encourage companies to develop new supply chains for critical minerals outside of China. As the U.S. relationship with China becomes increasingly adversarial, officials across Washington worry that relying on China for materials crucial for clean-energy technologies could leave the U.S. vulnerable.\n",
      "While China currently dominates the processing and refining of many critical minerals, Biden administration officials believe Japan, which already processes and refines critical minerals, could become a major part of an overhauled supply chain for the goods.\n",
      "Since the Biden administration is using executive authority to reach the agreement with Japan, it will not submit it to Congress for approval. The deal doesn't lift any trading barriers, and a senior Biden administration official said the U.S. and Japan currently impose no export duties for trading critical minerals between their countries. The two countries also agreed to share information about reviewing foreign investments into the minerals sector.\n",
      "Lawmakers in both parties have criticized the administration's push to make the agreements without receiving approval from Congress , calling it a violation of their constitutional authority. Biden administration officials have said they have consulted closely with lawmakers on the efforts.\n",
      "Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), a chief architect of the Inflation Reduction Act, has said that he intended for close U.S. allies and partners to meet the sourcing requirement for the electric-vehicle subsidies without needing additional trade agreements.\n",
      "\"I gotta be honest with you. I should have paused and said 'OK, I'm going to make sure our NATO allies are involved in this,' \" Mr. Manchin said at a recent energy conference in Houston. Mr. Manchin has been critical of several other choices the Biden administration has made in implementing the law.\n",
      "Biden administration officials see critical minerals agreements with members of the Group of Seven advanced democracies as the first piece of a broader strategy to reorient global supply chains away from China. Western officials have discussed forming a buyers club for critical minerals .\n",
      "Under such a buyers club, wealthy G-7 nations would offer financing and other development support to countries such as Zambia that are rich in the resourcesâ€”an effort to convince these nations to sell their minerals to the West instead of China.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTONâ€”President Biden's choice to head the nation's coming 250th anniversary commemorations is planning to relaunch the project on July 4, promising to get beyond the internal squabbles, mismanagement allegations and mushrooming litigation that have paralyzed the project for years.\n",
      "At a closed-door meeting Monday, Rosie Rios, chair of the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission, secured members' approval for her plans, which include gathering suggestions from the public about how the anniversary should be observed. She also intends to ask Congress for a significant increase in the commission's annual appropriation.\n",
      "Ms. Rios, who was U.S. treasurer in the Obama administration, said her new initiative, America's Invitation, would encourage \"the American public to suggest their own ideas, tell their own stories, share interesting narratives about their own experiences, about their own communities.\" Those suggestions would lead to a multiyear planning effort for 2026, she said, and \"a playbook that basically says, 'Americans have spoken, this is what we want to do.'\"\n",
      "The struggles of the anniversary project, known as America250, have included a botched alliance with Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., a defamation suit by one commissioner against others, and a workplace discrimination case against the project pending in federal court. The effort has consumed millions of dollars since Congress created the Semiquincentennial Commission in 2016.\n",
      "Other agencies aren't waiting for America250 to take the lead.\n",
      "\"We're each kind of doing things on our own,\" said Crosby Kemper, who as director of the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services holds a nonvoting seat on the commission. America250, he said, has been so consumed by \"organizational messiness that they haven't gotten terribly far. For a long period of time there hasn't been anyone there for us to talk to.\"\n",
      "Earlier this month, some 300 historians, curators and officials representing Semiquincentennial agencies, museums and historical organizations from more than 30 states met at the Colonial Williamsburg historic site in Virginia to begin nationwide planning on their own.\n",
      "\"We thought, 'Let's get together, let's collaborate, let's see where we can partner and make this meaningful nationally, across state boundaries,'\" said Cheryl Wilson, executive director of the Virginia American Revolution 250 Commission, adding that a couple of America250 commissioners attended.\n",
      "James Grossman, executive director of the American Historical Association, said while Ms. Rios brings new \"energy at the national level,\" other organizations \"have had to go off and say, 'We are going to do something.'\"\n",
      "Congress established the Semiquincentennial Commission to coordinate programs nationwide and made the heads of a dozen federal agencies, including the Library of Congress, the National Archives and the Smithsonian Institution, nonvoting members. Several of those agencies are moving forward with their own projects independent of the commission.\n",
      "Ms. Rios said she welcomed efforts by other groups. Not all the work done by America250 to date was for naught, she said, citing the development of a logo for the anniversary and Congress's approval for the minting of Semiquincentennial coins.\n",
      "Under former Chairman Daniel DiLella, the Semiquincentennial Commission gave its federal funds and program responsibilities to another entity, the America250 Foundation, where Mr. DiLella also was chairman. Several commissioners questioned the legality of the arrangement and the number of Mr. DiLella's friends and business associates who received contracts and positions of responsibility with America250.\n",
      "Mr. DiLella has denied wrongdoing and sued three fellow commissioners who criticized him for defamation, an allegation they deny.\n",
      "Mr. DiLella said the project turned the corner in 2021 when Joseph Daniels, former president of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, was hired as executive director of the America250 Foundation. Mr. Daniels scrapped much of the organization's initial planning and brought in his own team, but turmoil continued, including a discrimination lawsuit filed by female former executives and complaints from some commissioners that Mr. DiLella was running the organization with excessive secrecy and doing little to advance its mission.\n",
      "America250 denied the allegations and hired the firm Constangy Brooks Smith & Prophete to review the claims. According to a three-page executive summary circulated internally in September, the review found \"workplace culture issues\" but didn't support the allegations of systemic problems.\n",
      "\"Several witnesses noted the challenges that the infighting among the commission and the pending lawsuit have created, not only on the work that they do for the foundation, but on the morale of the staff,\" the review said.\n",
      "In June, Meta canceled a $10 million sponsorship deal , citing \"leadership dysfunction\" at America250. The following month, President Biden replaced Mr. DiLella as chairman with Ms. Rios, a longtime commission member who had been on Mr. DiLella's leadership team.\n",
      "At the request of Sen. Robert Casey (D., Pa.), who represented Senate Democrats on the commission, some lawmakers last year set aside $1 million for the Interior Department inspector general to investigate the Semiquincentennial project. Commission officials lobbied to kill that inquiry, and it ultimately was struck from the budget. Mr. Casey then resigned from the commission.\n",
      "\"Sen. Casey has been proud to represent the birthplace of our nation on the Semiquincentennial Commission, but he is no longer able to commit the amount of time and attention that he believes the commission needs,\" a spokeswoman said.\n",
      "Ms. Rios said she has taken steps to reorganize the project, parting ways with Mr. Daniels over what she called \"differing philosophies\" and consolidating commission and foundation operations. Mr. Daniels declined to comment.\n",
      "\"I'm not going to let any issues distract my team or me from the work that we need to do to deliver the best commemoration of America's anniversary that's ever been done,\" Ms. Rios said.\n",

      "Full text: Lyft Inc., grappling with competition and a battered stock price , is tapping a board member as its chief executive, and its two co-founders will step back from managing the company, the ride-sharing company said Monday.\n",
      "David Risher, who had management stints at Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. before starting a childhood-reading nonprofit in 2009, will take over from Logan Green, who co-founded Lyft with current President John Zimmer. The pair will retain their seats on the board but not participate in running Lyft day-to-day.\n",
      "Mr. Risher has been a Lyft board member since 2021.\n",
      "\"The macroeconomy is tough and the world is full of some uncertainty and that's a real factor for sure and, then, when you zoom in one click, the competitive environment is tough. We have a very aggressiveâ€”very aggressiveâ€”competitor,\" Mr. Risher said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.\n",
      "\"I think being a strong number two is a good place to be,\" he added. \"I like where we are, but we've got real work to do to fight it out a little bit.\"\n",
      "Lyft shares rose around 4% in after-hours trading Monday after the Journal reported the news.\n",
      "Lyft has struggled to keep up with its larger rival Uber Technologies Inc. Uber now commands 74% of the U.S. ride-share market, up from 62% in early 2020, according to consumer receipts analyzed by market-research firm YipitData. Lyft's market share has fallen to 26% from 38% over the same period, YipitData shows.\n",
      "Uber, which has a global and more diversified business, leveraged its food-delivery operations to deal with a driver shortage that crippled the ride-share industry as the economy reopened in 2021. Lyft chose not to get into food delivery and operates within the U.S. and Canada.\n",
      "Uber moved more quickly than Lyft to attract drivers with bonuses and some new features, many of which Lyft later implemented.\n",
      "Lyft hasn't reported an annual profit since its inception in 2012, but it has been trimming its losses. Last month, the company announced a weaker-than-expected revenue outlook for the current quarter.\n",
      "Late last year, the San Francisco-based company laid off more than 700 employees or 13% of staff and scaled back on other businesses, such as renting cars to customers, as it looked to weather a possible recession. Its stock has tumbled over 74% in the past 12 months. Uber's shares have fallen around 10% over that period.\n",
      "Messrs. Zimmer and Green said in an interview that they were stepping down for personal reasons. Mr. Green, who has four children, said he approached the board about finding a successor after his 39th birthday late last year \"prompted some reflections in terms of what I want in life.\"\n",
      "Mr. Risher said he was approached for the job earlier this year.\n",
      "\"This recent decision to pass the torch to David feels really good,\" Mr. Zimmer said. \"There's always things we could have done differently or better.\"\n",
      "One of the decisions that Mr. Green said he would reconsider was limiting Lyft's business to North America. Uber spent its early years expanding overseas, from where it now gets about 40% of its revenue. There is \"still a lot of upside and a lot of room\" for international expansion, Mr. Green said.\n",
      "Mr. Risher wouldn't say if he had plans to expand internationally.\n",
      "Mr. Green controls more than 20% of shareholder voting rights at the company. His interest in transportation was sparked by a stint in Zimbabwe as a college student when he noticed how carpooling was a popular option among neighbors and thought that there must be a better way to utilize all the empty car seats in the U.S.\n",
      "Mr. Zimmer worked at Lehman Brothers before giving that up to move to San Francisco to help launch the company which became Lyft. He has special shares that give him around 12% of the voting rights for the company. Mr. Zimmer said Monday that he had ferried passengers as a Lyft driver on New Year's Eve for more than a decade.\n",
      "The new CEO, Mr. Risher, said he hopes to add to what the two have built.\n",
      "\"My real opportunity is to take that foundation and take it to the next level,\" Mr. Risher said. \"A new person can help bring in even new energy. That's job one right now.\"\n",

      "Full text: Some financial regulators appear to have seized on a series of high-profile meltdowns to go around Congress and try to freeze an entire industry out of banking services.\n",
      "I spent more than a decade as a federal prosecutor on some of the worst threats our country facesâ€”organized crime, the opioid epidemic, political corruption and terrorism. In my final years at the Justice Department, I shifted to cases involving emerging technology, including the then-nascent crypto category, from the Mt. Gox hack to the corrupt Silk Road agents . Years later, the space continues to attract crime and fraud, but it has also drawn some of the brightest engineering talent in the world. Public blockchains, the foundational technology of the ecosystem, are an important set of tools that reflect breakthroughs in cryptography and distributed computing. In addition to early financial-use cases, this sector provides new ways to develop, monetize and govern all kinds of software.\n",
      "Unfortunately, members of this computing vanguard are being lumped in with the bad actors as part of a coordinated regulatory campaign to stymie progress in the sector. While other countries are putting in place laws and regulations, in the U.S. unelected officials are making major policy decisions about whether or not America should have a crypto industry. These efforts are misguided, reckless and potentially unconstitutional. Most important, they put America on the dangerous path of closing off the banking system to those disfavored by a particular administration.\n",
      "In January, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve issued a statement notifying financial institutions to be on alert for customers operating in the space, saying decentralized networks are \"highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.\" This ominous statement, coupled with seeming behind-the-scenes discouragement by their regulators, has led many banks to begin steering clear of almost any business touching blockchain technologies. In subsequent weeks, numerous banks shut their doors to this emerging sector, and regulators reportedly are conditioning sales of distressed banks on severing ties with the industry.\n",
      "A decade ago, in an effort called Operation Choke Point, the Justice Department, the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC tried to circumvent Congress using similar tacticsâ€”pressuring banks to cease business with specific industries , citing fraud prevention. Today, we are again seeing backroom tactics as a substitute for legislation, process and public regulation. Regardless of one's position on the underlying issue, these significant policy decisions should be made in an open and transparent way.\n",
      "This extralegal crackdown initially might not concern observers whose impressions of crypto are rooted in headlines about bad actors and outright criminals. But as four senators pointed out in a recent letter to the Fed, the FDIC and the OCC: \"When the Bernie Madoff fraud was uncovered, regulators did not pressure banks to cut off access to other asset managers.\"\n",
      "The teams my firm works with are developing applications beyond financial services. One CEO is a former Green Beret whose company is building products to keep personal data safe using cryptography. Others include a serial entrepreneur creating developer tools for decentralized technologies, and a team building tax and compliance software for digital assets. Several Coinbase alumni are building products that help creators monetize digital content outside TikTok and Meta-owned Instagram. These aren't scofflaws in cargo shorts committing theft.\n",
      "Whatever one believes about crypto (I realize many smart and reasonable people don't yet see the potential or need), major U.S. policy decisions should be made by Congress and state legislatures, not by unelected officials. If financial regulators are concerned about specific risks and believe new rules are appropriate, then they should follow procedures, including public notice and comment. If legislation is needed, that's up to Congress, but unelected officials shouldn't try to destroy an industry by freezing it out of the banking system.\n",
      "Imagine if more than a century ago regulators had cut Ford and General Motors off from banking services because they considered automobiles too risky, or too competitive with trains and horses. In 1980, Massachusetts securities regulators barred citizens from buying stock in Apple's IPO on the grounds that it was too \"risky.\" In the future, what if financial regulators were to warn banks against taking artificial-intelligence or alternative-energy customers because they're too risky? And because of semiconductors we now know what happens when America fails to keep key industries onshore.\n",
      "Meanwhile, other countries are working on regulating digital assets through a public process. Just this month, the U.K. reaffirmed its commitment to provide a framework for consultation to regulate digital assets, and the EU recently introduced a harmonized set of rules for all 27 member countries. Singapore, Dubai and Japan are all establishing rules to provide clarity to the industry. Hong Kong is developing a crypto-licensing regime, with the apparent blessing of Beijing . If American lawmakers don't provide a framework for decentralized technologies, then a major frontier of technological innovation will begin to move to more hospitable economies.\n",
      "America has long been a global leader in technology. Our regulators have risen to the occasionâ€”not stifling innovation but embracing technological advances while maintaining a fair, honest and trusted playing field. But the expedient political view threatens to choke off innovation and punish legitimate actors. Every lawful business should have access to the banking system. Government censorship as a backdoor substitute for the legislative process has no place in financeâ€”or any industry.\n",
      "Ms. Haun is CEO and founder of Haun Ventures, an investment firm specializing in decentralized technologies. She is a director of Coinbase and a former federal prosecutor.\n",

      "Full text: Dark clouds hovering over the U.S. banking sector may have ironically created a silver lining for emerging economies in Asiaâ€”lower oil prices.\n",
      "That comes as the key growth driver for much of the region, China, is ramping back up. Usually that would mean higher energy prices too, and inflation. But this time energy-hungry emerging Asian economies appear poised to benefit from China's reopening when inflationary pressures are actually easing.\n",
      "A slowdown in developed world demand will still hit exports. But emerging Asiaâ€”especially Chinese-tourism dependent economies such as Thailand and Singaporeâ€”could end up as growth outperformers this year if oil prices stay low and China's reopening stays on track.\n",
      "Both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are still focused on curbing inflation: Both central banks delivered a 0.25-percentage-point hike last week despite U.S. bank failures and the distressed sale of Credit Suisse in Switzerland. But monetary tightening has already slowed or stopped in most emerging Asian economies, such as India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia.\n",
      "Brent crude oil prices have fallen 10% in the last three months, according to Refinitiv data, and about 38% from their peak last year. Food prices are falling too. A United Nations' index of food-commodity costs eased 0.6% in February from January, down for the 11th straight month.\n",
      "That combination of falling food and oil prices is especially important for many Asian emerging markets, since food and energy tend to be a bigger portion of inflation baskets in poorer economies, and key Asian EMs are big food or energy importers. That contrasts with Latin America, where agricultural heavyweights such as Brazil get a lift from rising soy or meat prices.\n",
      "At the same time, the sturm and drang in the U.S. banking sector, which has seen the failure of midsize lender Silicon Valley Bank and another bank in recent weeks, isn't likely to have much direct impact on Asian EMs. Goldman Sachs reckons that U.S. bank closures and the consequent likely tightening of U.S. lending standards matter for Asia only to the extent they slow U.S. or foreign demand growth. Australian bank ANZ thinks that even if U.S. growth eases, the impact on Asia will be offset by China's reopeningâ€”actually boosting its safe-haven appeal.\n",
      "To be sure, export oriented economies like Vietnam will take a hit if demand from advanced economies slows sharply. And oil prices could still bounce back, especially if China's industrial and construction sectors increase further in the second half of the year. But a repeat of 2008â€”and its global falloutâ€”doesn't seem likely, at least for now.\n",
      "Emerging Asia is famous for its perennial monsoons, typhoons and other extreme weather. In 2023, parts of it might actually end up as a storm shelter instead.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTONâ€”President Biden's choice to head the nation's coming 250th anniversary commemorations is planning to relaunch the project on July 4, promising to get beyond the internal squabbles, mismanagement allegations and mushrooming litigation that have paralyzed the project for years.\n",
      "At a closed-door meeting Monday, Rosie Rios, chair of the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission, was set to update members on her plans, which include gathering suggestions from the public about how the anniversary should be observed and asking Congress to nearly double the commission's annual appropriation to $15 million.\n",
      "Ms. Rios, who was U.S. treasurer in the Obama administration, said her new initiative, America's Invitation, would encourage \"the American public to suggest their own ideas, tell their own stories, share interesting narratives about their own experiences, about their own communities.\" Those suggestions would lead to a multiyear planning effort for 2026, she said, and \"a playbook that basically says, 'Americans have spoken, this is what we want to do.'\"\n",
      "The struggles of the anniversary project, known as America250, have included a botched alliance with Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., a defamation suit by one commissioner against others, and a workplace discrimination case against the project pending in federal court. The effort has consumed millions of dollars since Congress created the Semiquincentennial Commission in 2016.\n",
      "Other agencies aren't waiting for America250 to take the lead.\n",
      "\"We're each kind of doing things on our own,\" said Crosby Kemper, who as director of the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services holds a nonvoting seat on the commission. America250, he said, has been so consumed by \"organizational messiness that they haven't gotten terribly far. For a long period of time there hasn't been anyone there for us to talk to.\"\n",
      "Earlier this month, some 300 historians, curators and officials representing Semiquincentennial agencies, museums and historical organizations from more than 30 states met at the Colonial Williamsburg historic site in Virginia to begin nationwide planning on their own.\n",
      "\"We thought, 'Let's get together, let's collaborate, let's see where we can partner and make this meaningful nationally, across state boundaries,'\" said Cheryl Wilson, executive director of the Virginia American Revolution 250 Commission, adding that a couple of America250 commissioners attended.\n",
      "James Grossman, executive director of the American Historical Association, said while Ms. Rios brings new \"energy at the national level,\" other organizations \"have had to go off and say, 'We are going to do something.'\"\n",
      "Congress established the Semiquincentennial Commission to coordinate programs nationwide and made the heads of a dozen federal agencies, including the Library of Congress, the National Archives and the Smithsonian Institution, nonvoting members. Several of those agencies are moving forward with their own projects independent of the commission.\n",
      "Ms. Rios said she welcomed efforts by other groups. Not all the work done by America250 to date was for naught, she said, citing the development of a logo for the anniversary and Congress's approval for the minting of Semiquincentennial coins.\n",
      "Under former Chairman Daniel DiLella, the Semiquincentennial Commission gave its federal funds and program responsibilities to another entity, the America250 Foundation, where Mr. DiLella also was chairman. Several commissioners questioned the legality of the arrangement and the number of Mr. DiLella's friends and business associates who received contracts and positions of responsibility with America250.\n",
      "Mr. DiLella has denied wrongdoing and sued three fellow commissioners who criticized him for defamation, an allegation they deny.\n",
      "Mr. DiLella said the project turned the corner in 2021 when Joseph Daniels, former president of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, was hired as executive director of the America250 Foundation. Mr. Daniels scrapped much of the organization's initial planning and brought in his own team, but turmoil continued, including a discrimination lawsuit filed by female former executives and complaints from some commissioners that Mr. DiLella was running the organization with excessive secrecy and doing little to advance its mission.\n",
      "America250 denied the allegations and hired the firm Constangy Brooks Smith & Prophete to review the claims. According to a three-page executive summary circulated internally in September, the review found \"workplace culture issues\" but didn't support the allegations of systemic problems.\n",
      "\"Several witnesses noted the challenges that the infighting among the commission and the pending lawsuit have created, not only on the work that they do for the foundation, but on the morale of the staff,\" the review said.\n",
      "In June, Meta canceled a $10 million sponsorship deal , citing \"leadership dysfunction\" at America250. The following month, President Biden replaced Mr. DiLella as chairman with Ms. Rios, a longtime commission member who had been on Mr. DiLella's leadership team.\n",
      "At the request of Sen. Robert Casey (D., Pa.), who represented Senate Democrats on the commission, some lawmakers last year set aside $1 million for the Interior Department inspector general to investigate the Semiquincentennial project. Commission officials lobbied to kill that inquiry, and it ultimately was struck from the budget. Mr. Casey then resigned from the commission.\n",
      "\"Sen. Casey has been proud to represent the birthplace of our nation on the Semiquincentennial Commission, but he is no longer able to commit the amount of time and attention that he believes the commission needs,\" a spokeswoman said.\n",
      "Ms. Rios said she has taken steps to reorganize the project, parting ways with Mr. Daniels over what she called \"differing philosophies\" and consolidating commission and foundation operations. Mr. Daniels declined to comment.\n",
      "\"I'm not going to let any issues distract my team or me from the work that we need to do to deliver the best commemoration of America's anniversary that's ever been done,\" Ms. Rios said.\n",

      "Full text: HARSEWINKEL, Germany -- When Russia invaded Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin was counting on soaring energy prices and falling confidence to sink European companies, undermining the West's support for Kyiv.\n",
      "One year later, many European companies have overcome the blow after slashing energy use and pivoting to a friendly and booming U.S. market. Such resilience has helped shore up political and popular support in Europe for Ukraine.\n",
      "Nowhere has the dynamic surprised as much as in Germany, a hub for energy-hungry manufacturers that had long relied on cheap supplies of Russian natural gas. Not only have German companies avoided the crash many economists predicted, but Berlin has also turned from relatively Kremlin-friendly into Kyiv's third-biggest arms supplier.\n",
      "One of these companies is Claas KGaA mbH, a manufacturer of agricultural machinery with 5 billion euros of annual revenue, the equivalent of around $5.4 billion, and about 12,000 employees.\n",
      "When Moscow's troops marched into Ukraine, Claas made about one quarter of its total sales in Central and Eastern Europe, including Russia. It has a large sales office in Ukraine and a plant in the Russian city of Krasnodar, 150 miles east of Crimea.\n",
      "Yet instead of retrenching, it cut production in Russia and China while increasing output at its main German factory by 30% last year. It reduced natural-gas consumption by almost one-third by making technical changes and has pivoted sales from Russia to the Americas.\n",
      "\"You look at what people and technical facilities you can use, and then you solve the problem,\" said Kai Gieselmann, a factory manager at Claas's headquarters.\n",
      "Claas reported a 3% increase in annual output last year to almost 5 billion euros and a smaller, but healthy, profit. A 6% decline in sales in Central and Eastern Europe including Russia was more than offset by sales growth of 35% in the Americas.\n",
      "The changes wrought by Russia's war \"won't go away. One lesson is that we are somewhat maneuvering into a new normal,\" said Claas Chief Executive Thomas Bock.\n",
      "One of the biggest consequences of the Ukraine war for Claas was the redrawing of its global client map. The company still operates its Russian plant -- combine harvesters are exempt from sanctions, it says -- but has written off its investment there, valued at 40 million euros.\n",
      "As they scoured for alternative markets last year, executives settled on the Americas and especially the booming U.S. market.\n",
      "\"The market was there and the money was there,\" Mr. Bock said.\n",

      "Full text: New York is poised to become the first state in the U.S. to pass a law banning natural-gas and other fossil-fuel hookups in new buildings, a step Democrats are pushing to help the state meet targets for greenhouse-gas reduction.\n",
      "The measure is on track to be added to the state's coming budget, which is due to be completed this week. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in January pitched an all-electric building mandate in her spending plan, and both chambers of the Democratic-controlled State Legislature included similar proposals in their respective budget outlines. One of the legislation's most noticeable effects would be an end to gas stoves in new homes, along with other gas-powered appliances such as water heaters, furnaces and clothes dryers.\n",
      "It faces opposition from some Republicans, labor unions, gas companies and business groups, citing concerns including affordability and reliability. Environmental groups have cheered the efforts.\n",
      "Democrats in Albany are still hammering out final details such as when the mandate would take effect, lawmakers said, though all proposals on the table take a phased-in approach. The suggested effective dates tossed around so far, for various kinds of buildings, range from as early as Jan. 1, 2025, to as late as Dec. 31, 2028. The Senate and Assembly measures would exempt uses such as commercial kitchens, hospitals, crematoriums, laboratories and laundromats, while the governor's office said a range of exemptions would be possible.\n",
      "\"The basic premise here is that if you continue to build buildings that are going to require fossil fuels for decades to come, you are baking in. . .destructive behavior that burning fossil fuels causes,\" said Democratic state Sen. Brian Kavanagh, an advocate in the Senate. \"The first step is to stop digging the hole deeper.\"\n",
      "Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt said the proposals would remove options. \"Seeking a cleaner energy future does not have to involve outright prohibitions on reliable, affordable energy,\" he said.\n",
      "Controversy over gas stoves flared nationally earlier this year following a news report that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission was considering a gas-stove ban on indoor-air health concerns. Republicans and some centrist Democrats cast the Biden administration as trying to outlaw a beloved way of cooking. The White House said President Biden didn't support a gas-stove ban.\n",
      "New Yorkers for Affordable Energy, a coalition that includes labor unions and gas companies, argues against a mandate, calling it unpopular with residents. A recent Siena College poll found that 53% of all New York respondents said they opposed the idea.\n",
      "\"Natural gas is going to continue to be part of the bridge between what we have now, with the heavy use of fossil fuel, and what we are going to have in the future,\" with more- renewable sources, said Daniel Ortega, of the coalition. \"Unless we are able to address reliability and affordability, none of this is going to work out.\"\n",
      "Under New York's proposals for banning fossil-fuel hookups, people who already have gas stoves could keep them.\n",
      "Passage of a statewide building electrification requirement could spur other states to follow, said Amy Turner, senior fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.\n",
      "Dozens of U.S. municipalities already have all-electric building mandates, and lawmakers in some Republican-led states have passed laws blocking cities from imposing such requirements.\n",
      "\"This is going to be the biggest way we can chop off a huge amount of the pollution,\" said Assembly member Emily Gallagher, a Democrat who sponsored an all-electric building bill.\n",

      "Full text: The economic fears gripping Wall Street have sparked outsize swings in oil prices, exacerbated by trading that investors and analysts say has little to do with the fundamental value of crude.\n",
      "One culprit is an arcane area of trading known on Wall Street as delta hedging, aimed at reducing the risks tied to directional price moves.\n",
      "This month, oil's steepest weekly slide in almost three years accelerated as futures approached levels where many producers owned derivatives designed to lock in prices. As declines mounted, banks and trading firms on the other side of those trades had to unload crude to mitigate potential losses, investors said, dragging benchmark prices to 15-month lows.\n",
      "Now, many expect similar dynamics could add momentum to any rebound if the economic outlook improves -- leading to more expensive oil that could increase the cost of gasoline and diesel later this year. It is the latest example of how volatility in financial markets can spill into the real world, shaking an oil industry stretching from the shale basins of Texas to refineries in China.\n",
      "The recent retreat \"in many ways had not a lot to do with oil,\" said Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura Group, at an industry confab hosted by the Financial Times last week. \"We got caught up in the macro world again, which happens all the time. It's OK,\" he added. \"But it distorts what happens in the future.\"\n",
      "In the coming week, investors will continue parsing the health of banks along with new readings on home prices, consumer confidence and the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge. A U.S. slowdown would eventually have big implications for crude and other commodities as well as stocks.\n",
      "Delta hedging revolves around a type of derivative known as put options, which are contracts granting their owner the right to sell oil or other investments at a specified price. For oil-and-gas producers such as EQT Corp. and Hess Corp., put options can function like a form of insurance, ensuring they can sell their output at a profit months in advance, even if prices fall.\n",
      "Banks and trading firms get paid premiums to sell puts. But the value of the options can rise -- saddling them with paper losses -- as crude approaches the \"strike\" price of the contracts. Traders can protect themselves either by buying puts of their own or by delta hedging, which in this case entails unloading crude futures.\n",
      "These types of trades can shake up all kinds of markets. When stocks endured bursts of volatility between long periods of calm in the years before the pandemic, some investors blamed hedging with derivatives. During the meme-stock craze, frenetic options trading in shares of companies such as GameStop Corp. and Tesla Inc. led to delta hedging that often amplified price swings in both directions.\n",
      "\"It's not just volatility to the downside,\" said Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at Swiss bank UBS Group.\n",
      "Oil has traded this year within a relatively narrow price range as investors weigh resurgent demand in China against growing recession fears in the U.S. and Europe. Worries about the banking sector fueled a fresh round of selling Friday, sending benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude futures down 1% to $69.26 a barrel.\n",
      "At Hess, which pumps oil from projects including offshore rigs near the coast of Guyana, the hedging strategy includes put options that cover about 65% of the company's projected crude output in 2023, a spokeswoman said. The New York-based company this year has bought contracts covering 80,000 barrels a day of U.S. crude output at $70 a barrel as well as 50,000 barrels a day of Brent, the global price gauge, at $75. \"Just like you have insurance in your home, you hope you never have to use it,\" said Hess Chief Financial Officer John Rielly, speaking at an investor conference this month.\n",
      "Crude prices recently began falling when stocks and bond yields dropped and algorithmic, trend-following trading programs began to sell oil futures, said Pierre Andurand, chief investment officer of Andurand Capital Management. His firm and other funds then sold some of the oil futures they owned to cut potential losses, he added.\n",
      "Options dealers were hedging puts on roughly 80 million barrels of crude oil with strike prices near $70 a barrel when oil dropped toward that level on March 15, according to Standard Chartered. As the possibility grew that financial institutions would need to pay out on those contracts, investors said those trading desks sold futures at an increasingly rapid clip. \"The more you do that, the lower the price goes and the more it pushes other people to do the same thing,\" said Ilia Bouchouev, managing partner at Pentathlon Investments. \"It's a chain reaction.\"\n",
      "The moves accelerated a selloff that pulled the domestic crude benchmark to $66.74 a barrel by the close on March 17, a 13% week-on-week drop that was the sharpest such decline since the pandemic dragged U.S. crude below $0 in April 2020.\n",
      "Eventually, lower prices encouraged some bullish traders as well as oil consumers -- such as airlines -- to step in and buy. That propelled prices higher before Friday's selloff eroded some of the gains.\n",
      "\"A lot of consumers were sitting on dry powder waiting for this move,\" said Brian Murphy, a derivatives broker at Tullett Prebon.\n",
      "Mr. Andurand, whose $1.3 billion hedge fund lost money in the recent rout, said his firm plans to rebuild its bullish position as energy markets stabilize. He is among the traders who think China's appetite for oil will push prices up later this year, even as some analysts suggest that demand outside Asia is sluggish and global supplies are plentiful.\n",
      "Mr. Andurand believes oil prices could reach as high as $140 a barrel later this year.\n",
      "\"Demand will really surprise. . .in a significant way,\" he said.\n",

      "Full text: ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance was only a budding oilman when he first set foot in Alaska. Nearly four decades later, his company reigns supreme over the U.S. Arctic.\n",
      "With most of its competitors abandoning the state, ConocoPhillips is forging ahead with drilling there, emboldened by President Biden's approval this month of a robust, new project.\n",
      "At a time when investors profess gloomy views of long-term demand for oil and demand quick returns from companies, Mr. Lance's contrarian strategy sets him apart. The CEO says that a dearth of investments in oil and gas means that the world will need new supplies of crude; as a result, he is pursuing a strategy to drill wells that will yield oil for decades.\n",
      "That plan is underpinned by ConocoPhillips investments in Alaska, where Mr. Lance's career started. He spent around 14 years there navigating the state's energy landscape, politics and, occasionally, its wildlife.\n",
      "An avid hunter and fisherman, Mr. Lance embraced the local lifestyle. The oil boss likes to tell people about the time he was hiking through the Kenai Mountains and crossed paths with a bear that chased him up a tree, said Don Wallette, a former chief financial officer at ConocoPhillips.\n",
      "People who know Mr. Lance said his experience in Alaska shaped his advocacy for the roughly $7 billion Willow project in the state's North Slope, which Mr. Biden greenlighted earlier in March. Willow cements ConocoPhillips's status as the largest producer in the state and gives it license to keep expanding, analysts said.\n",
      "Environmentalists argue Arctic drilling should be halted immediately to avoid a climate catastrophe. The project is expected to yield 180,000 oil barrels a day at its peak.\n",
      "\"These are larger-sized projects because we know the oil is going to be needed for decades,\" Mr. Lance said at the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference this month.\n",
      "While competitors Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. grab more headlines, Houston-based ConocoPhillips under Mr. Lance has quietly become one of the largest Western oil producers. The company's market capitalization, hovering around $118 billion, now exceeds that of British giant BP PLC, which was one of the largest producers in Alaska before selling all of its assets there in 2019.\n",
      "Alaska has been a reliable cash provider for ConocoPhillips. Between 2012 and 2022, the company's business there prospered to represent on average around a quarter of its annual profit, according to a Wall Street Journal review of regulatory filings.\n",
      "Mr. Lance, a Montana native, toiled away on drilling rigs in Wyoming to put himself through college and earn a petroleum engineering degree from Montana Tech University. When he failed to sign up for a job interview with oil company Atlantic Richfield Co., he brought a six-pack of Budweiser to the conference room where the recruiter was camping. He got an interview and nailed it, said Jerry Schuyler, the former recruiter and a confidant to Mr. Lance.\n",
      "Mr. Lance in 1984 joined Arco's Alaska unit -- a company whose assets wound up in ConocoPhillips' portfolio. It was a strategic move: Alaska at the time provided roughly a fourth of U.S. crude production.\n",
      "Mr. Lance soon was promoted from a job handling oil field data to one overseeing drill sites -- a task that required interacting with regulatory agencies and legislators in the state, said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Houston-based Pickering Energy Partners and a former Arco engineer in Alaska.\n",
      "\"Ryan got experience being not just a champion of technical projects, but understanding how the system worked,\" he said.\n",
      "Mr. Lance eventually became vice president of Arco's operations in the Western North Slope, part of a region that produces virtually all of Alaska's oil. Phillips Petroleum Co.'s acquisition of Arco Alaska in 2000 catapulted him up the corporate ladder. After Phillips merged with Conoco Inc., he was promoted to international roles, before being appointed CEO of the combined entity in 2012.\n",
      "Under Mr. Lance, the company shrank its global presence, in part to prioritize assets generating the highest returns and augment returns to investors. But even as the company shed assets from Algeria to Kazakhstan, it kept nabbing leases and acquiring competitors' wells in Alaska.\n",
      "Major oil companies including BP and Shell PLC once also coveted Alaska's oil riches. But regulatory challenges, combined with fruitless exploration efforts and the emergence of shale gushers from North Dakota to Texas refocused some drillers' attention away from the remote, capital-intensive Arctic, leaving ConocoPhillips ample room for new business.\n",
      "\"What we're seeing in Alaska is a departure of the bigger companies,\" said Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who has supported Willow. \"Conoco has made a commitment, and they're sticking by it.\"\n",
      "Willow has earned ConocoPhillips scorn from environmental groups, who say the project will emit climate-warming gases for decades. But it has found support among some Alaska Natives' associations and the Alaska delegation in Congress. Proponents say Willow could generate local, state and federal revenue of up to $17 billion and create jobs.\n",

      "Full text: Ukrainian officials called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.\n",
      "Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, in a written statement released Sunday, said moving the weapons to Belarus would undermine nuclear nonproliferation treaties .\n",
      "\"Ukraine expects effective actions to counter the nuclear blackmail of the Kremlin,\" the statement said, before calling on the other permanent members of the Security Council to intervene. \"We demand to immediately convene an extraordinary meeting of the U.N. Security Council for this purpose.\"\n",
      "Mr. Putin said in remarks published Saturday that Russia would finish building a storage facility for its tactical nuclear weaponsâ€”which are designed for battlefield use and aren't large enough to wipe out entire citiesâ€”in Belarus by July. The announcement is the latest in a string of steps the Russian president has taken to remind Ukraineâ€”and, more important, its alliesâ€”of Moscow's nuclear capabilities .\n",
      "A spokesman for the White House said the administration is closely monitoring the issue but thus far hasn't seen evidence that Mr. Putin had moved nuclear weapons or planned to use them in Ukraine.\n",
      "\"We would agree that no nuclear war should be fought, no nuclear war can be won, clearly that would cross a major threshold,\" John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" He said, \"We've seen nothing that would cause us to change our own strategic deterrent posture.\"\n",
      "Poised to punch back\n",
      "Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko hasn't publicly commented on the announcement, but Mr. Putin told a state television program on Sunday that the Belarusian leader has \"long raised the question of deploying Russian tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus.\"\n",
      "\"There is nothing unusual here either: Firstly, the United States has been doing this for decades,\" Mr. Putin added. \"They have long deployed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allied countries, NATO countries, in Europe.\"\n",
      "North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials rejected a parallel. \"Russia's reference to NATO's nuclear sharing is totally misleading,\" spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said on Twitter. She said NATO countries act in line with their international commitments, while \"Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments.\"\n",
      "Last summer, Mr. Lukashenko said his military's Su-24 warplanes had been modified to carry nuclear weapons, a move that had been agreed upon with Mr. Putin, Belarusian state news agency Belta reported at the time.\n",
      "Western officials and analysts largely played down the significance of the announcement. Moscow has been using Belarus as a launchpad for assaults on Ukraine since the start of the invasion and has already sent Iskander-M missiles, which are nuclear-capable and can deliver a payload of over 500 kilograms to most of Ukraine's territory, into the country.\n",
      "Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who supporters believe rightfully won the country's 2020 presidential vote, said Saturday that Russia's deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus violates the country's constitution and contradicts the will of the Belarusian people to remain a non-nuclear state.\n",
      "\"Russia acts as the occupying force, violating national security and putting Belarus on the collision course with its neighbors and the international community,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n",
      "The German Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, accused Mr. Putin of \"another attempt at nuclear intimidation,\" according to German media.\n",
      "Josep Borrell, the European Union's foreign policy chief, tweeted Sunday that \"Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation and threat to European security.\" He said the EU \"stands ready to respond with further sanctions,\" if Minsk follows this course of action.\n",
      "The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said the announcement about stationing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus was part of an information campaign designed to inflame Western fears of nuclear escalation, \"which remains extremely low.\"\n",
      "\"Russia has long fielded nuclear-capable weapons able to strike any target that tactical nuclear weapons based in Belarus could hit,\" the institute wrote. \"Putin is a risk-averse actor who repeatedly threatens to use nuclear weapons without any intention of following through.\"\n",
      "Mr. Putin said Sunday that Russia would on April 3 start training crews to use tactical nuclear weapons.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the United Nations nuclear regulator, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Saturday that its director would again travel to inspect the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear-power plant this week. The visit would be his second since the start of the full-scale invasion last year.\n",
      "\"Despite our presence at the site for seven months now, the situation at the [Zaporizhzhia] Nuclear Power Plant is still precarious,\" the agency's head, Rafael Grossi, said. \"The nuclear safety and security dangers are all too obvious.\"\n",
      "In addition, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Russia was being resupplied with Iranian-made Shahed drones . After a two-week pause in drone attacks in February, Moscow has launched 71 into Ukraine since the start of March. The drone attacks, launched from Russian territory, are \"likely to be a further attempt to stretch Ukrainian air defenses,\" the ministry wrote on Twitter.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Russia continued missile and artillery strikes across much of Ukraine over the weekend. All of the Ukrainian regions that border Russia were hit, as were the partially occupied regions in the south, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. Five civilians were killed and 25 others were injured.\n",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said Sunday that its troops were undertaking active operations in the areas of Kupyansk, in Ukraine's northeast, Donetsk in the east, and Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south.\n",
      "Though fighting in and around the eastern city of Bakhmut has slowed in recent days, Ukraine's armed forces said Russian forces \"continue to storm the city,\" while also targeting nearby settlements, such as Chasiv Yar, with artillery fire.\n",

      "Environmentalists argue Arctic drilling should be halted immediately to avoid a climate catastrophe . The project is expected to yield 180,000 oil barrels a day at its peak.\n",
      "\"These are larger-sized projects because we know the oil is going to be needed for decades,\" Mr. Lance said at the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference earlier this month.\n",
      "While competitors Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. grab more headlines, Houston-based ConocoPhillips under Mr. Lance has quietly become one of the largest Western oil producers. The company's market capitalization, hovering around $118 billion, now exceeds that of British giant BP PLC, which was one of the largest producers in Alaska before selling all of its assets there in 2019.\n",
      "Alaska has been a reliable cash provider for ConocoPhillips. Between 2012 and 2022, the company's business there prospered to represent on average around a quarter of its annual profit, according to a Wall Street Journal review of regulatory filings.\n",
      "Mr. Lance, a Montana native, toiled away on drilling rigs in Wyoming to put himself through college and earn a petroleum engineering degree from Montana Tech University. When he failed to sign up for a job interview with oil company Atlantic Richfield Co., he brought a six-pack of Budweiser to the conference room where the recruiter was camping. He got an interview and nailed it, said Jerry Schuyler, the former recruiter and a confidant to Mr. Lance.\n",
      "Mr. Lance in 1984 joined Arco's Alaska unit â€”a company whose assets wound up in ConocoPhillips' portfolio. It was a strategic move: Alaska at the time provided roughly a fourth of U.S. crude production.\n",
      "Mr. Lance soon was promoted from a job handling oil field data to one overseeing drill sitesâ€”a task that required interacting with regulatory agencies and legislators in the state, said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Houston-based Pickering Energy Partners and a former Arco engineer in Alaska.\n",
      "\"Ryan got experience being not just a champion of technical projects, but understanding how the system worked,\" he said.\n",
      "Mr. Lance eventually became vice president of Arco's operations in the Western North Slope, part of a region that produces virtually all of Alaska's oil. Phillips Petroleum Co.'s acquisition of Arco Alaska in 2000 catapulted him up the corporate ladder. After Phillips merged with Conoco Inc., he was promoted to international roles, before being appointed CEO of the combined entity in 2012.\n",
      "Under Mr. Lance, the company shrank its global presence, in part to give priority to assets generating the highest returns and augment returns to investors. But even as the company shed assets from Algeria to Kazakhstan, it kept nabbing leases and acquiring competitors' wells in Alaska.\n",
      "Major oil companies including BP and Shell PLC once also coveted Alaska's oil riches. But regulatory challenges, combined with fruitless exploration efforts and the emergence of shale gushers from North Dakota to Texas refocused some drillers' attention away from the remote, capital-intensive Arctic, leaving ConocoPhillips ample room for new business.\n",
      "\"What we're seeing in Alaska is a departure of the bigger companies,\" said Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who has supported Willow. \"Conoco has made a commitment, and they're sticking by it.\"\n",
      "Willow has earned ConocoPhillips scorn from environmental groups, who say the project will emit climate-warming greenhouse gases for decades. But it has found support among some Alaska Natives' associations, local politicians and the Alaska delegation in Congress. Proponents say that Willow could generate local, state and federal revenue of up to $17 billion and create more than 2,000 construction jobs and 300 permanent jobs.\n",
      "The project almost didn't happen. In 2017, ConocoPhillips said it had found a trove of oil in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve, a 23-million-acre area managed by the U.S. Interior Department. But a federal judge in 2021 threw out the Bureau of Land Management's approval of the proposed development, dubbed Willow, saying the agency had failed to fully account for the project's environmental impact, and that the agency needed to conduct more studies.\n",
      "Among the options explored by the bureau to reduce Willow's footprint was that its scale be brought down from five drill sitesâ€”the company's initial planâ€”to three. ConocoPhillips made it clear that anything less than three pads wouldn't make the project viable. Mr. Lance made sure the company didn't bend on that point, people close to him said.\n",
      "Last year, as Mr. Lance made the case for Willow in earning calls, ConocoPhillips amped up its lobbying spending.\n",
      "The company shelled out nearly $8.7 million, according to OpenSecrets , a nonpartisan group that tracks political spendingâ€”more than what Exxon or Chevron disbursed that year. It listed continued advocacy for Willow among other issues it was lobbying for, according to quarterly lobbying reports.\n",
      "A spokesman for ConocoPhillips said it had increased its engagement with key stakeholders on a range of energy issues and other legislation, including Willow.\n",
      "Ultimately, Mr. Biden gave a down-to-the-wire approval of Willow over fierce objections from environmentalists and many Democrats who wanted the project scuttled. The company was cleared to build three pads.\n",
      "Environmental groups earlier this month sued the Biden administration to stop the project. ConocoPhillips has started building ice roads but agreed to pause some development until a federal judge has reviewed environmentalists' request to halt construction activities pending litigation, according to court filings.\n",
      "ConocoPhillips has said it doesn't expect Willow to start churning out oil until around 2029. Those who know Mr. Lance say he believes his strategy will prevail.\n",
      "\"He believes in the long haul, the right answer will usually float to the surface,\" said Mr. Schuyler, the former Arco recruiter.\n",

      "Full text: New York is poised to become the first state in the U.S. to pass a law banning natural-gas and other fossil-fuel hookups in new buildings, a step Democrats are pushing to help the state meet targets for greenhouse-gas reduction .\n",
      "The measure is on track to be added to the state's coming budget, which is due to be completed this week. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in January pitched an all-electric building mandate in her spending plan, and both chambers of the Democratic-controlled State Legislature included similar proposals in their respective budget outlines. One of the legislation's most noticeable effects would be an end to gas stoves in new homes, along with other gas-powered appliances such as water heaters, furnaces and clothes dryers.\n",
      "It faces opposition from some Republicans, labor unions, gas companies and business groups, citing concerns including affordability and reliability. Environmental groups have cheered the efforts.\n",
      "Democrats in Albany are still hammering out final details such as when the mandate would take effect, lawmakers said, though all proposals on the table take a phased-in approach. The suggested effective dates tossed around so far, for various kinds of buildings, range from as early as Jan. 1, 2025, to as late as Dec. 31, 2028. The Senate and Assembly measures would exempt uses such as commercial kitchens, hospitals, crematoriums, laboratories and laundromats, while the governor's office said a range of exemptions would be possible.\n",
      "\"The basic premise here is that if you continue to build buildings that are going to require fossil fuels for decades to come, you are baking inâ€¦destructive behavior that burning fossil fuels causes,\" said Democratic state Sen. Brian Kavanagh, an advocate in the Senate. \"The first step is to stop digging the hole deeper.\"\n",
      "Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt said the proposals would remove options for consumers. \"Seeking a cleaner energy future does not have to involve outright prohibitions on reliable, affordable energy,\" he said.\n",
      "Controversy over gas stoves flared nationally earlier this year following a news report that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission was considering a gas-stove ban on indoor- air health concerns . Republicans and some centrist Democrats cast the Biden administration as trying to outlaw a beloved way of cooking. The White House said President Biden didn't support a gas-stove ban.\n",
      "New Yorkers for Affordable Energy, a coalition that includes labor unions and gas companies, argues against a mandate, calling it unpopular with residents. A recent Siena College poll found that 53% of all New York respondents said they opposed the idea.\n",
      "\"Natural gas is going to continue to be part of the bridge between what we have now, with the heavy use of fossil fuel, and what we are going to have in the future,\" with more- renewable sources, said Daniel Ortega, of the coalition. \"Unless we are able to address reliability and affordability, none of this is going to work out.\"\n",
      "He cited December's blizzard in Buffalo that caused widespread power outages as an illustration of electricity's limitations.\n",
      "Mr. Kavanagh, who represents lower Manhattan, said the Senate bill allows backup power sources using fossil fuels, and added that modern buildings often have battery-storage capacity.\n",
      "Under New York's proposals for banning fossil-fuel hookups, people who already have gas stoves could keep them. That would also be true under a separate proposal from Ms. Hochul to prohibit the sale of any new fossil-fuel heating equipment and related systems for existing homes and buildings starting in 2030.\n",
      "Passage of a statewide building electrification requirement could spur other states to follow, said Amy Turner, senior fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.\n",
      "\"New York state is a big place. Parts of it are politically purple to red. It has areas of very cold climate,\" she said.\n",
      "Dozens of U.S. municipalities, including many Democratic-led cities in California and elsewhere, already have all-electric building mandates, and lawmakers in some Republican-led states have passed laws blocking cities from imposing such requirements. In late 2021, New York City mandated that most new buildings be constructed fully electric.\n",
      "Some states have pursued similar goals without legislation. Last year the Washington State Building Code Council moved to require heat pumps as the main heating source in buildings. The changes, which take effect in July, allow gas heat pumps and the use of gas supplemental heating.\n",
      "The New York state Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, passed in 2019, calls for a reduction in economywide greenhouse-gas emissions of 40% by 2030 and 85% by 2050 from 1990 levels.\n",
      "\"This is going to be the biggest way we can chop off a huge amount of the pollution,\" said Assembly member Emily Gallagher, a Democrat who sponsored an all-electric building bill.\n",

      "Full text: The economic fears gripping Wall Street have sparked outsize swings in oil prices, exacerbated by trading that investors and analysts say has little to do with the fundamental value of crude.\n",
      "One culprit is an arcane area of trading known on Wall Street as delta hedging, aimed at reducing the risks tied to directional price moves.\n",
      "Earlier this month, oil's steepest weekly slide in almost three years accelerated as futures approached levels where many producers owned derivatives designed to lock in prices. As declines mounted, banks and trading firms on the other side of those trades had to unload crude to mitigate potential losses, investors said, dragging benchmark prices to 15-month lows.\n",
      "Now, many expect similar dynamics could add momentum to any rebound if the economic outlook improvesâ€”leading to more expensive oil that could increase the cost of gasoline and diesel later this year. It is the latest example of how volatility in financial markets can spill into the real world, shaking an oil industry stretching from the shale basins of Texas to refineries in China.\n",
      "The recent retreat \"in many ways had not a lot to do with oil,\" said Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura Group, at an industry confab hosted by the Financial Times last week. \"We got caught up in the macro world again, which happens all the time. It's OK,\" he added. \"But it distorts what happens in the future.\"\n",
      "In the coming week, investors will continue parsing the health of banks, along with new readings on home prices, consumer confidence and the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge. A U.S. slowdown would eventually have big implications for crude and other commodities, as well as stocks.\n",
      "Delta hedging revolves around a type of derivative known as put options, which are contracts granting their owner the right to sell oil or other investments at a specified price. For oil-and-gas producers such as EQT Corp. and Hess Corp., put options can function like a form of insurance, ensuring they can sell their output at a profit months in advance, even if prices fall.\n",
      "Banks and trading firms get paid premiums to sell puts. But the value of the options can riseâ€”saddling them with paper lossesâ€”as crude approaches the \"strike\" price of the contracts. Traders can protect themselves either by buying puts of their own, or by delta hedging, which in this case entails unloading crude futures.\n",
      "These types of trades can shake up all kinds of markets. When stocks endured bursts of volatility between long periods of calm in the years before the pandemic, some investors said hedging with derivatives was to blame . During the meme-stock craze, frenetic options trading in shares of companies such as GameStop Corp. and Tesla Inc. led to delta hedging that often amplified price swings in both directions.\n",
      "\"It's not just volatility to the downside,\" said Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at Swiss bank UBS Group.\n",
      "Oil has traded this year within a relatively narrow price range as investors weigh resurgent demand in China against growing recession fears in the U.S. and Europe. Worries about the banking sector fueled a fresh round of selling Friday, sending benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude futures down 1% to $69.26 a barrel.\n",
      "At Hess, which pumps oil from projects including offshore rigs near the coast of Guyana, the hedging strategy includes put options that cover about 65% of the company's projected crude output in 2023, a spokeswoman said. The New York-based company this year has bought contracts covering 80,000 barrels a day of U.S. crude output at $70 a barrel, as well as 50,000 barrels a day of Brent, the global price gauge, at $75.\n",
      "\"Just like you have insurance in your home, you hope you never have to use it,\" said Hess Chief Financial Officer John Rielly, speaking at an investor conference this month.\n",
      "Crude prices recently began falling when stocks and bond yields dropped and algorithmic, trend-following trading programs began to sell oil futures, said Pierre Andurand, chief investment officer of Andurand Capital Management. His firm and other funds then sold some of the oil futures they owned to cut potential losses, he added.\n",
      "Options dealers were hedging puts on roughly 80 million barrels of crude oil with strike prices near $70 a barrel when oil dropped toward that level on March 15, according to Standard Chartered. As the possibility grew that financial institutions would need to pay out on those contracts, investors said those trading desks sold futures at an increasingly rapid clip.\n",
      "\"The more you do that, the lower the price goes and the more it pushes other people to do the same thing,\" said Ilia Bouchouev, managing partner at Pentathlon Investments. \"It's a chain reaction.\"\n",
      "The moves accelerated a selloff that pulled the domestic crude benchmark to $66.74 a barrel by the close on March 17, a 13% week-on-week drop that was the sharpest such decline since the pandemic dragged U.S. crude below $0 in April 2020 .\n",
      "Eventually, lower prices encouraged some bullish traders as well as oil consumersâ€”such as airlinesâ€”to step in and buy. That propelled prices higher before Friday's selloff eroded some of the gains.\n",
      "\"A lot of consumers were sitting on dry powder waiting for this move,\" said Brian Murphy, a derivatives broker at Tullett Prebon.\n",
      "Mr. Andurand, whose $1.3 billion hedge fund lost money in the recent rout, said his firm plans to rebuild its bullish position as energy markets stabilize. He is among the traders who think China's appetite for oil will push prices up later this year, even as some analysts suggest that demand outside Asia is sluggish and global supplies are plentiful.\n",
      "Chinese refiners have recently snapped up supertanker shipments of oil in a sign that China's long-awaited recovery from pandemic lockdowns is finally beginning to take hold. Citing mobility data in China and the restart of international flights in and out of the country, Mr. Andurand believes oil prices could reach as high as $140 a barrel later this year.\n",
      "\"Demand will really surpriseâ€¦in a significant way,\" he said.\n",

      "Full text: The United Auto Workers elected reform candidate Shawn Fain as its next leader, marking an upheaval in the union's top ranks and creating a wild card for auto makers ahead of contract talks in Detroit.\n",
      "Mr. Fain, a 54-year-old who started his career as an electrician and rose through the UAW ranks while working at factories now owned by Stellantis NV, has struck a more strident tone ahead of negotiations later this year.\n",
      "His reform group has vowed to not give any concessions to the car companies and raised the possibility of a strike when contracts expire this fall.\n",
      "\"Today we put the companies on notice. The fighting UAW is back,\" Mr. Fain said in a video address after his victory.\n",
      "Mr. Fain declared victory on Saturday, narrowly defeating incumbent Ray Curry, who issued a statement saying Mr. Fain would be sworn in as president on Sunday. It is the first time in more than 70 years that a challenger defeated a presidential candidate from the UAW's longtime ruling party.\n",
      "The office of the federal monitor overseeing the election filed the final tally to a U.S. District Court in Michigan on Saturday. Those results, which had Mr. Fain winning 69,459 to 68,976, aren't considered certified until all election-related challenges are resolved.\n",
      "The election of Mr. Fain is a turning point for the UAW, which represents more than 400,000 workers in the automotive sector and other industries and is emerging from a yearslong corruption scandal . His campaign vowed to root out any residual corruption, while also taking the toughest stance against auto makers of any union leadership since the 1940s.\n",
      "\"This election was not just a race between two candidates, it was a referendum on the direction of the UAW,\" Mr. Fain said in a statement.\n",
      "The UAW represents roughly 145,000 hourly members at U.S. factories owned by General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Ram, Chrysler and other U.S.-sold brands. The coming negotiations, which occur every four years, are set to begin this summer ahead of the expiration of the current labor contracts in September.\n",
      "Mr. Fain's victory heightens the chance of a UAW strike at one of the auto makers, Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan wrote in a recent research note.\n",
      "\"The new reform candidates have less national bargaining experience and are promising an aggressive stance,\" he said.\n",
      "This year's round of collective bargaining was already setting up to be particularly contentious, with potential flashpoints over wages, high inflation and job security as the auto makers switch to electric vehicles .\n",
      "Meanwhile, the companies are in belt-tightening mode. GM recently said it plans to cut $2 billion in costs by next year and this month offered voluntary buyouts to most of its roughly 58,000 white-collar U.S. workers. Ford cut about 3,000 white-collar jobs and contract positions last year.\n",
      "The union vote resulted from a shift in the way the UAW selects top officials. Historically, leaders of the union's local chapters elected the UAW's top officers. In late 2021, the union's rank-and-file voted to change the election procedure to allow members to directly cast ballots to pick their leaders.\n",
      "The vote on the election change was required under terms of a civil settlement between the Justice Department and the UAW in 2020, following a multiyear federal investigation that led to the convictions of more than a dozen top UAW officials, including two former presidents .\n",
      "The corruption scandal eroded members' trust in the UAW's leadership, factory workers have said, and provided momentum to Mr. Fain and his reform group.\n",
      "Federal prosecutors, in filing charges against prior union leaders, described a culture of corruption that included kickback schemes, embezzlement and other illicit activities. Under terms of the settlement, a federal monitor oversees the union's finances and other activities, including the recent election.\n",
      "Mr. Fain and the other candidates on his reform-minded UAW Members United slate have said they want to unify a divided membership, ensure equal pay and benefits for workers at varying levels of the union and increase the value of retirees' pensions.\n",
      "\"The UAW officers, the people elected to lead and serve this great union have taken bribes, stolen dues and betrayed the trust of the membership. That ends here,\" Mr. Fain said in the Saturday video address.\n",
      "Mr. Fain faces a divided executive board, about half of which is filled by his caucus. The broader membership, too, is divided, based on Mr. Fain's narrow victory margin, said Marick Masters, a professor of business with a focus on labor at Wayne State University in Detroit.\n",
      "\"You have an opportunity now to see the extent to which rank-and-file may be dissatisfied with the current leadership,\" he said.\n",
      "Mr. Fain has been involved in contract negotiations both at the national level and at Chrysler Corp. factories, now owned by Stellantis, according to his group's website.\n",
      "As the auto industry develops more electric vehicles, which are less labor-intensive to produce than internal-combustion-engine cars, preserving manufacturing jobs in gas-engine plants will be a focus of the UAW, leaders have said. Late last year, Stellantis stopped operations at a 1,350-employee assembly plant in Illinois, citing the expensive EV transition as one reason it needed to cut costs.\n",
      "The UAW's last round of collective bargaining for a four-year contract in 2019 resulted in a 40-day strike at GM's U.S. factories, which drained more than $3 billion from the company's bottom line.\n",
      "The coming contract negotiations will be unfolding in a different economic and social environment from the 2019 talks. Rising inflation has eroded workers' spending power, while organized labor in the U.S. has been reinvigorated in recent years. Worker-driven labor movements have picked up energy over the past two years, including strikes at farm-equipment maker Deere & Co. and snack-food company Mondelez International Inc.\n",

      "\"Everything we do, at every stage, must be reinforcing the message: there is a new sheriff in town,\" said a draft transition-plan document from early February that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal and verified by the Fain campaign.\n",

      "Full text: TEHRANâ€”Iran's move to reset diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia was a radical break from years of enmity between the two Middle East rivals, but it hasn't been enough to prop up its struggling economy.\n",
      "Before China stepped in to broker the deal earlier this month, Iran's currency, the rial , had lost a fifth of its value over the last two weeks of February to hit a record low, adding to the problems besetting the ruling clerics here.\n",
      "Inflation was already rising, hitting 59% late last year, and talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal and get some relief from U.S. sanctions were all but dead. European powers had given up on a separate mechanism to transfer funds to Iran for humanitarian aid. Prisoner-swap negotiations with the U.S. weren't progressing either, keeping billions of dollars in overseas bank accounts out of reach. The Americans had also begun cracking down on flows of hard currency from neighboring Iraq , removing an important pressure valve.\n",
      "\"The economic situation is a major part of why right now the Iranians decided to make this de-escalation agreement with the Saudis,\" said Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at Washington's Middle East Institute.\n",
      "But while news of the deal helped ease the strain on the rial in the short term, pushing it off its historic low of more than 600,000 to the dollar, the currency has since lost value as the reality sinks in that, even with the Saudi deal, the country has few prospects for a turnaround unless it can escape sanctions over its nuclear program or build closer economic ties with China and Russia.\n",
      "\"It's a thin market that lives and dies on headlinesâ€”and the headlines have been good the past few weeks,\" said Henry Rome, a senior fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n",
      "But, he said, \"inflation, especially food, is very high and rising, and the government is doing little to reel it in.\"\n",
      "The approach of Nowruzâ€”the two-week Persian New Year holiday that began Mondayâ€”was a flashpoint. Middle-class Iranians found themselves with much diminished purchasing power for the rice, meat and other ingredients for the holiday's feasts, and retired teachers, social-security officials and military personnel were protesting economic conditions across the country.\n",
      "Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged the scope of the problems in a speech Tuesday marking Nowruz.\n",
      "\"If, God willing, we are able to reduce the economic problems and if, God willing, our officials make an effort, practice diligence and work hard on important tasks in this field, many of the country's other problems will also be solved,\" Mr. Khamenei said, according to the state-run news agency IRNA.\n",
      "Iran's clerical leaders have promised to tackle inflation before without success. When Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi took office in 2021 he vowed to reduce inflation to below 15% in 2023 and to single digits in 2024, but prices have only escalated, raising pressure on the government.\n",
      "Inflation remains rampant at more than 50%, with the cost of meat rising by 90% over the past year, according to the semiofficial ISNA news agency. When reformist newspaper Sazandegi reported about rising anger about food prices with a dramatic front-page headline, \"Meat Rebellion,\" on Feb. 20, it was immediately shut down.\n",
      "Ordinary Iranians say they have had trouble affording the ingredients to prepare Nowruz meals this week.\n",
      "\"We have become numb against inflation,\" said Alireza Babaie, a home-appliances salesman. \"We don't feel anything anymore.\"\n",
      "Economists and traders say Saudi Arabia and Iran's other neighbors are unlikely to pour significant amounts of cash into the Islamic Republic despite Tehran's restoring diplomatic ties with Riyadh. Western sanctions remain a powerful deterrent.\n",
      "They also say Saudi Arabia would want to see if Tehran holds up its end of the deal by halting covert weapons shipments to its Houthi allies in Yemen , where Iran and Saudi Arabia had been fighting a proxy war.\n",
      "The resumption of diplomatic relations would help broaden political and economic cooperation in the region, Iranian Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said after the China-brokered deal was signed.\n",
      "There are some positive signs for Iran, chiefly its growing involvement with China, which increasingly is positioning itself as a global diplomatic counterpoint to the U.S.\n",
      "Beijing's role in facilitating the deal between the two Middle East rivals signals that it intends to continue buying oil from both Saudi Arabia and Iran, ensuring Tehran a continuing economic lifeline, said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, chief executive officer of Bourse and Bazaar, a London-based think tank that studies the Iranian economy.\n",
      "Iran also has a growing military relationship with Russia, supplying drones for use in its war in Ukraine , and it is trying to expand other trade flows with Moscow. It is also negotiating with the West to retrieve some oil-revenue funds locked in countries such as South Korea, though with little success.\n",
      "Besides these relationships and the improvement in the relationship with Saudi Arabia, Iran has few other options to alleviate its problems and improve the prospects for its 88 million people. In January, the World Bank predicted its economy would grow 2.2% this year and by 1.9% in 2024â€”less than it needs to put it back on a sustainable long-term growth track.\n",

      "Full text: HARSEWINKEL, Germanyâ€”When Russia invaded Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin was counting on soaring energy prices and falling confidence to sink European companies, undermining the West's support for Kyiv.\n",
      "One year on, many European companies have overcome the blow after slashing energy use and pivoting to a friendly and booming U.S. market. Such resilience has helped shore up political and popular support in Europe for Ukraine.\n",
      "Nowhere has the dynamic surprised as much as in Germany, a hub for energy-hungry manufacturers that had long relied on cheap supplies of Russian natural gas . Not only have German companies avoided the crash many economists predicted, but Berlin has also turned from relatively Kremlin-friendly into Kyiv's third-biggest arms supplier.\n",
      "One of these companies is Claas KGaA mbH, a manufacturer of agricultural machinery with 5 billion euros of annual revenue, the equivalent of around $5.4 billion, and about 12,000 employees.\n",
      "When Moscow's troops marched into Ukraine, Claas made about one quarter of its total sales in Central and Eastern Europe, including Russia. It has a large sales office in Ukraine and a plant in the Russian city of Krasnodar, 150 miles east of Crimea.\n",
      "Yet instead of retrenching, it cut production in Russia and China while increasing output at its main German factory by 30% last year. It reduced natural-gas consumption by almost one-third by making technical changes and has pivoted sales from Russia to the Americas.\n",
      "\"You look at what people and technical facilities you can use, and then you solve the problem,\" said Kai Gieselmann, a factory manager at Claas's headquarters.\n",
      "Claas reported a 3% increase in annual output last year to almost â‚¬5 billion and a smaller but healthy profit. A 6% decline in sales in Central and Eastern Europe including Russia was more than offset by sales growth of 35% in the Americas.\n",
      "The changes wrought by Russia's war \"won't go away. One lesson is that we are somewhat maneuvering into a new normal,\" said Claas Chief Executive Thomas BÃ¶ck.\n",
      "Claas's pivot started on the morning of Russia's invasion, on Feb. 24, 2022. That day, Mr. BÃ¶ck was woken at 4 a.m. by a call from one of his managers.\n",
      "\"People were really under attack, you could hear bombs falling, on the phone,\" he said.\n",
      "His immediate problem was to reshuffle operations in Ukraine and Russia. The company's top officials assembled in offices adjacent to its factory in the West German town of Harsewinkel, known officially as \"combine harvester city.\"\n",
      "Claas sourced key parts in Russia and Ukraine, including gears and large metal components. Executives fretted about whether they would be able to receive payments from Russia and if they would have enough cash to shore up their supply chain.\n",
      "Then as Moscow began throttling natural-gas supplies to Europe came another question: \"What does this mean for energy?\" said Henner BÃ¶ttcher, the company's chief financial officer.\n",
      "Claas executives said they used game theory to figure out how Berlin would ration fuel that millions of households rely on for heatingâ€”if it came to thatâ€”and figured that the company wouldn't be shut off because of its proximity to Europe's gas hub in the Netherlands.\n",
      "Still, the executives had to develop a contingency plan that would allow the company to survive a 30% decline in gas supplies. At its core was the decision to refit furnaces and heating systems so that they could run on oil as well as gas, including by installing new pipes.\n",
      "To keep the refitted furnaces humming, Claas bought and stored two million liters of oil on site. It also spent â‚¬300,000 to build liquefied-petroleum gas tanks and signed a supply contract for LPG delivery, which arrives by truck from the Netherlands.\n",
      "As gas prices surged to almost 20 times their 2021 levels, energy-hungry producers of critical components were coming under pressure across Germany, reducing production. For Claas, that created shortages of products such as gearboxes and rubber tractor tires, which compounded pandemic-era bottlenecks for components like microchips.\n",
      "The company developed software to keep abreast of problems at its hundreds of suppliers, using data to make long-term forecasts about where shortages might emerge.\n",
      "Senior managers meet daily on the factory floor, at 9:45 a.m., to check on supplies and identify potential bottlenecks, said Mr. Gieselmann.\n",
      "\"There are 240,000 parts in the combine harvester and I feel like I know every one,\" said Mr. BÃ¶ttcher. His supplies task force meets at 7 a.m. every day, with procurement managers looking at how many parts are missing.\n",
      "To cut its energy bill, the company made simple changesâ€”switching lightbulbs for LEDs, turning down the heating and eliminating warm water in some washrooms, plus some more complex ones. Workers in Claas's paint shop found a way to lower the temperature of treating metals before they are painted by changing the chemicals in the vats. That reduced the temperature needed for the process from 95 degrees Fahrenheit to 68 degrees, room temperature.\n",
      "On the factory floor, three energy scouts constantly look for new ways to curb use. Digital counters around the factory show how much energy is being consumed. Employees are motivated to find small savings by being rewarded with a share of the money. One recent suggestion: Two similar metal parts were adapted so that only one part would be needed.\n",
      "A machine now recycles heat from the bench where combines' engines are tested, and uses it to heat the air in the factory. That saves 90% of energy costs in that step of the production process.\n",
      "Compounded across Germany, such efforts added up, slashing the country's energy consumption by around one-quarter, according to data by the German energy regulator.\n",
      "To address parts shortages, Claas managers stepped into the market directly to support smaller suppliers, using the company's clout as a big customer or tapping its contact books to source parts such as microchips.\n",
      "Sometimes, these effort involved resorting to unconventional fixes. Claas welded parts for one Dutch supplier at its German factory before shipping them back to the Netherlands. Its board members flew around the world to twist arms and loosen supply-chain blockages. One purchasing manager snapped up parts for a supplier on his personal credit card at the weekend.\n",
      "\"Everything is based on a long-term relationship,\" said Mr. BÃ¶ck.\n",
      "One of the biggest consequences of the Ukraine war for Claas was the redrawing of its global client map. The company still operates its Russian plantâ€”combine harvesters are exempt from sanctions, it saysâ€”but has written off its investment there, valued at â‚¬40 million.\n",
      "As they scoured for alternative markets last year, executives settled on the Americas and especially the booming U.S. market.\n",
      "\"The market was there and the money was there,\" Mr. BÃ¶ck said.\n",
      "U.S. farmers could still benefit from Trump administration subsidies, while the strong dollar allowed Claas to offer low prices compared with local competitors, a spokesman said.\n",
      "Claas has a factory in Omaha, Neb., and its largest combine harvester model, the Lexion, won the \"Coolest German Thing Made in the U.S.A.\" Award in October, presented by the German-American Chambers of Commerce.\n",
      "Claas's global supply chain also looks very different from a year ago. The company moved processes such as welding out of China and back to Harsewinkel. Economists say a number of German businesses have reshored production from China to Germany in recent years, in part to avoid U.S. tariffs, while others have transferred assets to countries politically allied with the West in a practice often referred to as friendshoring.\n",
      "Instead of Russia, Claas now buys parts for combine harvesters and telescopic handlers, which are similar to forklifts, in Eastern Europe and Germany, and large pre-assembled metal components in the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania.\n",
      "Claas's German factories still run mostly on gas, but it is sourced from friendly countries such as the U.K. and Norway. Wholesale gas prices appear to be settling at about double the average level over the last decade and are expected to remain higher than other regions such as the U.S.\n",
      "Despite all the changes, Claas wasn't left entirely unscathed. Some of its processes are now costlier, which has eaten into its profitability and dented its competitiveness, executives say. Mr. BÃ¶ttcher, the CFO, said the company now has significantly lower margins than competitors in the U.S. and Japan.\n",
      "\"The export model is robust, but in a different form,\" said Mr. BÃ¶ck, the CEO. The lesson of the past few years, he says: \"Don't be dependent on one country.\"\n",

      "Full text: Manipulation of earnings from Corporate America is on the rise, an ominous omen for the U.S. economy.\n",
      "That is the conclusion of new research on accounting fraud, using a technique that flagged Enron as an earnings manipulator several years before the energy company's spectacular 2001 implosion.\n",
      "Unless you study accounting, you have likely never come across the M-Score, which is the number underlying both the Enron episode and the economywide concern now. The \"M\" is for manipulation, and uses a company's financial statements to determine whether it is engaging in manipulation.\n",
      "Since the 1990s, the metric has been used to identify red flags at individual companies. Now Messod D. Beneish, a professor of accounting at Indiana University who developed the M-Score in the 1990s, and several co-authors have calculated an aggregate score for nearly 2,000 companies. It shows a disturbing pattern in the historical data: The probability of manipulation usually rises rapidly in the quarters before the economy tips into recession.\n",
      "\"We think this is a measure of misinformation in the economy,\" said Dr. Beneish. The new aggregate measure was published in a December paper, and the latest data -- compiled in March and shared with The Wall Street Journal -- shows that the collective probability of fraud across major companies is the highest in over 40 years.\n",
      "The M-Score is calculated from eight ratios on a company's balance sheet, all numbers that public companies report quarterly, and comparing the ratios to earnings statements from a year earlier.\n",
      "For example, one of the eight metrics raises a flag if a company abruptly starts reporting more \"receivables,\" that is, more money owed to the firm but not yet paid. Another flag goes up if a company reports higher values of assets that cannot be sold, and that aren't clearly identified as plants, property or equipment. A third looks at changes in accruals, which is when an expense has been incurred, but not yet paid. Another identifies whether companies change how much depreciation they take.\n",
      "There are ways for companies to manipulate all these metrics to appear profitable even when actual sales aren't improving.\n",
      "Of course, there could be legitimate reasons for any of these. A customer might have placed a large order toward the end of the quarter, yet won't pay until early in the next quarter. A drug company might have purchased a major patent, which isn't easily sold. It isn't a factory, but it is genuinely very valuable.\n",
      "But collectively, if these metrics are moving in the wrong direction, it suggests funny business.\n",
      "The M-Score's most famous moment came when it was revealed that three years before Enron's collapse, a group of students at Cornell University's business school, under accounting professor Charles Lee, used Dr. Beneish's model to flag that Enron \"may be a company manipulating its earnings.\" Though their report was posted online, it received little attention until after Enron's collapse.\n",
      "The model also flagged the German payment-processor Wirecard AG. Its spectacular collapse after accounting fraud was exposed in 2020 drew comparisons with Enron.\n",
      "Dr. Lee, now a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, says that any of the eight metrics wouldn't necessarily mean trouble. But when the score of the combined metrics is rising, it shows \"a growth company, with core businesses that are eroding, that is running out of economic steam and using aggressive accounting,\" he said. Even if the accounting is legitimate, he added, \"you may want to avoid that company.\"\n",
      "Similar scores have been popular in accounting since the late 1960s. There is the Altman Z-score, created in 1968 by Edward Altman, for predicting whether companies are at risk of bankruptcy, and the Dechow F-Score, from the University of Southern California's Patricia Dechow, designed to predict accounting misstatements.\n",
      "Models such as the M-Score aren't necessarily smoking guns. They will sometimes flag legitimate businesses, especially with mergers and acquisitions. Strange shifts occur when companies absorb each other. They are, though, a reason to look more closely.\n",
      "\"You cannot take it to court and say, 'Look, this company has a big M-Score and must be a fraud,'\" said Dr. Lee. \"But statistically, this fits the profile of a manipulator.\"\n",
      "In aggregate, when more firms are reporting sales that haven't actually been completed, declining asset quality or any of the other indicators, it likely indicates that something in the economy is beginning to go wrong.\n",
      "And there is no shortage of signs of strain in the economy right now. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, several high-profile banks have collapsed, manufacturing activity has slowed and home prices are declining. Still, there is reason to think that the M-Score has something to add to the traditional numbers used to take stock of economic activity.\n",
      "False information on balance sheets has \"real economic effects because it represents misinformation on which firms base their investment, hiring, and production decisions,\" Dr. Beneish and his co-authors -- David Farber of Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis and Matthew Glendening and Kenneth Shaw, both of the University of Missouri -- wrote in December.\n",
      "The theory is that their index might be catching distress in the stages when some companies are taking steps to try to cover it up. That is when conditions on the ground are beginning to deteriorate, but firms are continuing to report strong earnings. The stock market might behave like the corporate sector is still humming along when in reality, its earnings are increasingly buoyed by tricks.\n",
      "The scholars' aggregate index is too new to have much of a record. Financial history is littered with recession predictors that worked great using historical data that promptly failed when used to predict the future. It didn't work \"out of sample,\" as statisticians would say. So, it remains to be seen how useful the aggregate M-Score will be.\n",
      "But if there are a lot of things on balance sheets right now that look like fraud, that is probably not a great thing.\n",

      "Full text: OTTAWA -- President Biden, making his first trip as president to Canada, said a robust U.S. industrial policy based on producing clean technology, electric vehicles and semiconductors would benefit workers on both sides of the northern border as he joined with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n",
      "Mr. Biden used an address to the Canadian Parliament to promote their commitment to defending Ukraine, and possibilities for workers through the new healthcare and climate-change law called the Inflation Reduction Act, and another law to promote semiconductor manufacturing. \"We must never doubt our capacity for Canada and the United States to do big things, to stand together. . . . We're going to write the future together,\" he said.\n",
      "The two leaders have maintained warm personal ties, going back to Mr. Biden's time as vice president, and the two sides planned to confer on a range of defense, economic and migration issues.\n",
      "Mr. Trudeau said the two nations are coordinating during \"serious times,\" citing the \"consequences of a warming planet\" that are \"intersecting with the aftermath of a global pandemic.\" He said the passage of Mr. Biden's legislation would mean \"clients for Canadian critical minerals processors, for our clean energy innovators, for our integrated auto workers, for our farmers, growers and producers and so many others.\"\n",
      "The Inflation Reduction Act offers extensive tax credits and other support for clean-energy projects. The incentives have sparked a flood of investments in the U.S., and to Canada.\n",
      "As part of the meetings, the U.S. and Canada reached an deal that would allow both countries to turn back asylum seekers who unlawfully cross the northern border, which has seen an influx in crossings between New York and Quebec.\n",
      "Under the agreement, which begins Saturday, Canada would provide 15,000 slots for migrants to enter legally over the next year on a humanitarian basis from the Western Hemisphere.\n",
      "The meetings in the Canadian capital followed Chinese President Xi Jinping's talks this week in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Messrs. Biden and Trudeau have been staunch allies of Ukraine, and the White House expressed skepticism about China's interest in negotiating a cease-fire in Ukraine, saying it would provide Russian forces with an opportunity to regroup.\n",
      "\"We've stood together to defend sovereignty, to defend democracy,\" Mr. Biden said. The U.S. and Canada \"must stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine with as much as it takes, for as long as it takes,\" Mr. Trudeau said.\n",
      "On defense, Canada unveiled a timetable on spending plans to upgrade its defense capability in the Arctic, to track and detect threats from Russia and China. U.S. officials pushed Canada to accelerate spending plans, and issue firm commitments on funding sources. Canada said some of the new detection systems could start operating in 2028.\n",

      "Full text: BROWNSVILLE, Texas -- Some 1,000 trucks a day arrive from Mexico at a border checkpoint here near the southern tip of Texas. Their first stop is a white-and-yellow painted metal portal where energy beamed at the trucks produces X-ray images to try to spot fentanyl and other contraband.\n",
      "Such scrutiny is rare. Across the southern border, most U.S.-bound trucks and nearly all passenger vehicles are generally scanned selectively if they are pulled aside. Mexican cartels have long profited from these odds while smuggling fentanyl and other narcotics. Their illicit trade propelled the U.S. to a record of nearly 107,000 fatal overdoses in 2021, the most recent year of full data.\n",
      "The U.S. wants to increase routine scanning to try to stanch this flow. President Biden called for more drug-detection technology in last month's State of the Union speech and this month's budget proposal, which included $305 million for new inspection systems, including the technology used in Brownsville.\n",
      "Mexican cartels are the main source of fentanyl, producing it in makeshift labs with Chinese chemicals, according to U.S. law-enforcement authorities. Though cartels have many ways to smuggle in drugs -- from mailed packages to secret tunnels and pedestrian couriers -- authorities said fentanyl is most often hidden in cars and trucks and driven through border checkpoints.\n",
      "\"They're just blitzing the country through the ports of entry,\" said Derek Maltz, a retired Drug Enforcement Administration official who spent 28 years in the agency.\n",
      "The scanners in Brownsville beam energy at a truck in varying levels of intensity. Beaming less energy at the cab allows drivers to stay inside, speeding the process. Directing more energy at the trailer produces an image of the truck that officials can use to spot suspect material within. Sometimes the payload is illicit drugs including fentanyl.\n",
      "Fentanyl's properties make it ideal for smuggling, drug-enforcement experts said. Cars and trucks make more than 200,000 trips across the southern border into the U.S. every day.\"The sheer volume is one of the biggest challenges that we have,\" said Jody Hardin, executive director for planning program analysis and evaluation at U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Office of Field Operations.\n",
      "The explosive opioid problem and violent cartel crime have heightened tensions between the U.S. and Mexico. Just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, in the city of Matamoros, gunmen from a local cartel in March kidnapped four Americans, killing two.\n",
      "Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has denied that fentanyl is produced in Mexico while touting renewed cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico in attempts to stop the synthetic opioid from flowing north. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas visited Nogales, Ariz., on March 21 to announce busts following a law-enforcement operation aimed at fentanyl trafficking.\n",
      "Through the first five months of the fiscal year that began in October, CBP said it seized about 11,000 pounds of drugs identified as fentanyl. This is nearly as much as was seized in the full 2021 fiscal year and approaches the 14,700 pounds seized in fiscal 2022. Mr. Mayorkas said the new law-enforcement operation netted some 1,700 pounds of drugs identified as fentanyl, methamphetamine and cocaine.\n",
      "Customs officials want to perform more of what they call nonintrusive inspections, which includes the multi-energy portals on display in Brownsville, to increase the efficiency of processing the huge volume of vehicles arriving daily.\n",
      "\"At the onset we saw a drastic increase in narcotics seizures,\" said Tater Ortiz, who directs the Brownsville port of entry. But a string of busts was followed by a plunge in confiscations as smugglers went elsewhere, he said.\n",
      "The U.S. aims to deploy 123 large-scale scanners along the border by fiscal 2026, growing its ability to perform nonintrusive scans to 70% of cargo vehicles and 40% of passenger vehicles, according to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Historically, the U.S. has performed such scans on only 17% of cargo vehicles and 2% of passenger vehicles, the office said.\n",
      "Adding more scanning technology has to be part of an effort that includes trying to reduce drug demand and the odds overdoses will prove fatal, said David Luckey, a senior Rand Corp. researcher. \"There's no silver bullet,\" he said.\n",
      "Outside Culiacan, home to the Sinaloa Cartel, the operator of a fentanyl lab and counterfeit pill factory said he isn't bothered by the prospect of new technology. \"They don't stop all the cars,\" he said. \"There are lots of ways.\"\n",
      "He said the price of fentanyl has fallen in recent months from about $5,000 per kilogram to $3,500 per kilogram as more people get into the business.\n",
      "At the Brownsville bridge, tractor-trailer trucks line up each day in lanes for their scans. Mr. Ortiz said he doesn't expect a panacea against drug smugglers. \"They always try something new,\" he said. \"So I'm sure we will have troubles in the future.\"\n",

      "Full text: SEOUL -- South Korea's LG Energy Solution Ltd. said it would invest about $5.6 billion in a battery-manufacturing complex in Arizona, the latest in a string of new plants by foreign companies as the U.S. transitions toward cleaner fuels.\n",
      "LG Energy said Friday that the new battery complex in Queen Creek, Ariz., would mainly serve electric-vehicle makers in North America.\n",
      "The amount is about four times as large as what the firm had initially pledged when it first revealed plans last year to manufacture cylindrical batteries for electric vehicles in Arizona, though the project had been up in the air until Friday's announcement. LG Energy said in June 2022 that it was reassessing its investment options due to unprecedented economic conditions. Inflation has been driving up the costs of raw materials and other expenses for manufacturers worldwide.\n",
      "The complex announced Friday will consist of two battery plants and mark the largest investment ever for a stand-alone battery-manufacturing facility in North America, LG Energy said.\n",
      "LG Energy's announcement comes as battery makers have been pushing to build up a bigger production base in the U.S., which is looking to strengthen its local supply chains and reduce reliance on China while speeding up shifts to green technologies.\n",
      "The Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act has offered billions of dollars in tax credits for EVs sold in the U.S., but applies only if they have a certain value of their battery components assembled in North America. LG Energy said the Arizona plant would meet the eligibility requirements of the EV tax-credits program.\n",
      "\"We believe it's the right move at the right time in order to empower [the] clear energy transition in the U.S.,\" LG Energy Chief Executive Kwon Young-soo said.\n",
      "The EV tax-credits program has stoked complaints from foreign car makers, but has opened business opportunities for non-Chinese battery players including South Korea's LG Energy, Samsung SDI Co. and SK On Co., as well as Japan's Panasonic Holdings Corp., which have all announced plans for new manufacturing plants in the U.S., including many via joint partnership with auto makers.\n",

      "Full text: Vladimir Putin seeks to prevail in Ukraine through an exhausting war of attrition in which he outlasts his opponents, or so the expert consensus has it. The U.S. is supplying weapons to Ukraine at a remarkably slow pace, perhaps for fear of provoking a calamitous Russian escalation. It seems as if Washington is playing right into Mr. Putin's hands.\n",
      "But maybe not everything is as it seems. If I learned anything from decades as a Russian-speaking Central Intelligence Agency operations officer working against the Kremlin's intelligence services, it was to be wary of anything they show you. This looks to me too convenient a narrative for Moscow, and one that's belied by the facts.\n",
      "WSJ Opinion Live Q&A: The New World Disorder\n",
      "The threats to global stability and the US homeland are growing. How will the war in Ukraine end? Can China and the US develop a less combative relationship? Join historian and Journal columnist Walter Russell Mead and editorial page editor Paul Gigot for an interactive conversation on the threats to US security.\n",
      "Mr. Putin acts as if he doesn't believe he can survive if he quits this conflict. But in reality, the war is existential only for the Ukrainian side. Ukrainians would suffer cultural genocide and war crimes if they gave in. Russia can walk away without serious consequences beyond its borders, and Mr. Putin knows it. He can ill afford for the Russian people to realize that they could not only overcome defeat, but never had to fight in the first place. But it's not clear that the solution the Kremlin really wants is a war of attrition.\n",
      "Can anyone, even Mr. Putin, imagine the Ukrainians quitting? If they lose external support, they still face an existential threat. It seems probable Ukraine would dig in and fight as long as it possibly could, even if the conflict devolved to guerrilla warfare in occupied streets.\n",
      "Mr. Putin has to be accounting for this. He gambled wrong a year ago when he expected Ukrainian resolve to collapse quickly as Russian forces rolled in. Though he projects an inflexible image, Mr. Putin seems to still think like an intelligence officer. They rarely make the same mistake twice, particularly when they've been embarrassed. Were he really as reckless and blind to reality as he's sometimes depicted, Russian forces wouldn't have withdrawn from Kyiv's outskirts a year ago. Mr. Putin has shown that he will bend when faced with serious consequences.\n",
      "And that's what a long war would entail. Mr. Putin might not grieve his heavy casualties, but they are embarrassing to the Kremlin and undermine his narrative of strength and military prowess. As Russian lines thin, he will feel increased pressure to expand mobilization beyond the rural and ethnic communities he has targeted to insulate his urban political base from the war's consequences.\n",
      "While some scoff at the effectiveness of Western economic sanctions, Moscow is furiously working to strengthen the ruble and find alternative consumers for the energy exports most of Europe has forsaken. But this still means lower profit, as Russia lures clients with increasingly discounted oil and gas. As the war endures, Mr. Putin will meet increasingly difficult choices between funding the conflict and improving the economy. And whatever military supplies Russia seeks from China, Iran and North Korea are hardly charitable donationsâ€”there's no dictator's discount. Even ruble remittances from new trade partners won't help Mr. Putin pay off foreign debt held in U.S. dollars. And less income leaves less resources to dispense to those domestic political allies Mr. Putin needs to maintain control.\n",
      "All this suggests that the longer the war endures, the worse things get for Moscow. Time allows Ukraine to deploy the sophisticated weapons now en route and the freshly trained Ukrainian operators returning from the West. More time will also enable the increased productivity of ammunition supply chains the U.S. is building. Add it all up, and Ukraine will likely have what's needed for its much-anticipated counteroffensive. Mr. Putin may repulse those forces, but betting everything that he can is an immensely risky gamble. If Ukraine prevails, could he survive losing Crimea and having his forces violently pushed back across Russian borders?\n",
      "Mr. Putin likely doesn't hope for a war of attrition but wants the world to think he does. His disinformation campaigns have been designed to depict himself, and Russia, as stronger than they are. If he faces an unwinnable war, the best outcome he can hope for is to mask that weakness and intimidate his foes into blinking first. Ukraine may not want to give up, but if an outside power can broker a peace deal, that is Mr. Putin's best option by a long shot. His openness to China's lopsided peace proposal suggests that he is eager to fold with gains still in hand.\n",
      "What he likely most fears is the U.S. and its allies slamming the accelerator. Pushing the Russian leader isn't without risk, but validating his narrative is more likely to weaken Western resolve and escalate the conflict by inviting him to test its thresholds. It's imperative that Washington instead work to make the war too costly to Mr. Putin to remove any doubt of Western resolve. Be wary of whatever cards he chooses to show.\n",

      "Full text: CAIROâ€”After years of underinvestment in North Africa's energy infrastructure, global oil-and-gas giants from Halliburton Co. and Chevron Corp. to Eni SpA are ramping up their presence in the region as demand from Europe grows .\n",
      "Executives in the industry are betting it is worth drilling again in some of the hardest places to do business in the world as Europe increasingly turns to other sources for its energy needs after shunning its main supplier, Russia, over the invasion of Ukraine . In recent months, a string of European officials have visited the region to help advance talks over potential supply deals.\n",
      "Halliburton and Honeywell International Inc. are hammering out $1.4 billion worth of deals to develop an oil field and refinery with National Oil Corporation in Libya, which has the largest known oil reserves in Africa, according to the chairman of state-owned firm, Farhat Bengdara. Italy's Eni is planning investments aimed at replacing nearly half of the gas it was importing from Russia with gas from Algeria.\n",
      "Chevron is also looking to seal an energy exploration deal in Algeria, The Wall Street Journal reported last month . In January, the U.S. oil major announced a sizable natural-gas discovery in Egypt.\n",
      "\"North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,\" said Geoff Porter, president of U.S.-based North Africa Risk Consulting Inc. But with Europe needing to replace Russian energy , \"this is their moment,\" he said.\n",
      "Western oil executives say they see a more stable political climate in North Africa, especially in countries such as Libya where fighting between local militias has been subdued in the past two years following nearly a decade of civil war. Many American firms had pulled back from the region, viewing it as politically too risky, to focus on shale production at home. The region's proximity to Europe and massive reserves, with Algeria holding the third-largest recoverable shale resources in the world, also make doing business there worth the risk, they say.\n",
      "At the same time, state-owned firms in the North African region have been eager to strike deals, as they see an opportunity to fill a gap left by Russia and take advantage of higher global commodity prices. Some countries, such as Egypt, are eager to bring in additional revenue from selling energy, as their economies struggle with higher import costs including for food . The Ukraine war has disrupted shipments and pushed up global commodity prices.\n",
      "\"I think we can be a good replacement for Russian gas to Europe,\" NOC's Mr. Bengdara said.\n",
      "The Libyan state-owned company is expected to soon sign a $1 billion agreement with Halliburton that will allow the U.S. firm to rebuild the al-Dhara oil field, according to Mr. Bengdara. The oil field in central Libya was destroyed by Islamic State militants in 2015 and is now run by ConocoPhillips and TotalEnergies SE, Mr. Bengdara said. It would be one of the biggest deals for the U.S. oil-services giant clinched in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years.\n",
      "Halliburton and Total didn't respond to requests for comment. ConocoPhillips declined to comment.\n",
      "Libya's NOC and Honeywell are set to unveil a contract related to the construction of a refinery in southern Libya, Mr. Bengdara and a spokesman for the American firm said. The initial deal, expected to be announced this weekend, is for the design of the plant, the spokesman said, which would be followed by a $400 million pact to build the entire plant.\n",
      "Libya relies heavily on its oil resources for income, although it has struggled for years to turn its own crude into motor fuel, making it largely dependent on costly gasoline imports.\n",
      "As of last year, the North African nation was divided politically again, with a United Nations-appointed prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, remaining in control of the capital Tripoli and a rival prime minister taking charge of the country's east. The country is again pushing to hold presidential and legislative elections this year, after plans fell through in 2021.\n",
      "Still, there have been no serious clashes since last summer and its eastern government in recent months has unlocked some of the budget needed by the state oil company to clinch deals with international companies.\n",
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a senate committee on Wednesday that the U.S. was actively working to reopen an embassy in Libya, in part so it could better support the prospect of Libyan elections. The U.S. shut its embassy in Tripoli in 2014 following violent clashes between militias.\n",
      "The U.S. also pressured a top Libyan commander in mid-January to expel Russia's paramilitary Wagner Group , the Journal reported last month, amid fears the unit may tap into the country's oil riches. Khalifa Haftar, commander of a faction that controls eastern Libya , is aligned with the government in Tripoli .\n",
      "\"There is recognition in the U.S. that Libya is a workable environment,\" said Mr. Porter, who advises U.S. oil companies in the region. He added that firms now see it as \"an environment in which you can operate reasonably safely, where you can more predictably invest in ways that you could not have a few years ago.\"\n",
      "NOC exports most of its gas to Europe through a pipeline from Libya to Italy. Over the next three to five years, it aims to increase oil production to 2 million barrels a day, from around 1.2 million currently, and to produce 4 billion standard cubic feet of gas a day, up from roughly 2.6 billion.\n",
      "In January, NOC and Eni, which produces the majority of the country's gas, signed an $8 billion deal for the Italian energy giant to develop two gas fields to pump 850 million cubic feet a day for 25 years. Under the agreement, production of gas will start in 2025, ramping up to full capacity of 850 million cubic feet a day by 2026.\n",
      "In Algeria, Eni is aiming to export an additional 3 billion cubic meters of gas annually, starting this year, to help make up for gas that used to flow from Russia. Algeria will become the firm's top region for investment in the next four years.\n",
      "\"Algeria is a reliable partner of absolute strategic importance,\" said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during a visit to Algiers in January.\n",
      "From Egypt, Eni aims to export three billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Italy starting this year, after regas capacity was built up on the receiving end. That compares with roughly 1 billion cubic meters being exported last year.\n",
      "Egypt's ability to export gas is limited given the growing electricity demand of its more than 100 million population. It doesn't have any pipelines to Europe. Still, the country has ambitions to become a hub for energy distribution in the Mediterranean, importing more gas from Israel and exporting liquefied gas on ships to Italy.\n",

      "Full text: OTTAWAâ€”President Biden, making his first trip as president to Canada , said a robust U.S. industrial policy based on producing clean technology, electric vehicles and semiconductors would benefit workers on both sides of the northern border as he joined with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n",
      "Mr. Biden used an address to the Canadian Parliament to promote their commitment to defending Ukraine in its war against Russia , and future possibilities for workers through the new healthcare and climate change law called the Inflation Reduction Act, and another law to promote semiconductor manufacturing.\n",
      "\"We must never doubt our capacity for Canada and the United States to do big things, to stand together, do them together, rise together. We're going to write the future together,\" Mr. Biden told members of Parliament, who frequently interrupted his address with applause.\n",
      "Canada is frequently among the first visits by a new U.S. president, but Mr. Biden's trip was delayed in part due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The two leaders have maintained warm personal ties, going back to Mr. Biden's time as vice president, and the two sides planned to confer on a range of defense, economic and migration issues.\n",
      "Mr. Trudeau, in an address to Parliament welcoming Mr. Biden, said the two nations were serving alongside each other during \"serious times,\" citing the \"consequences of a warming planet\" that are \"intersecting with the aftermath of a global pandemic.\"\n",
      "Mr. Trudeau said the passage of Mr. Biden's legislation would mean \"clients for Canadian critical minerals processors, for our clean energy innovators, for our integrated auto workers, for our farmers, growers and producers and so many others.\"\n",
      "The Inflation Reduction Act offers extensive tax credits and other support for clean-energy projects, ranging from wind farms to factories that make solar-energy components or batteries. The incentives have sparked a flood of investments in the U.S., and to Canada as well. Canada is one of the few places in the Western Hemisphere with the raw materials required for the clean-energy transition, and the U.S. credits also cover products made in Canada.\n",
      "America's clean-energy incentives have prompted governments in Europe and Asia to mull their own set of financial incentives to maintain or attract investments. The European Union plans to allow matching subsidies for specific European clean-tech sectors that officials believe are at risk from the IRA.\n",
      "As part of the meetings, the U.S. and Canada reached an agreement that would allow both countries to turn back asylum seekers who unlawfully cross the northern border, which has seen an influx in border crossings between New York and Quebec.\n",
      "Under the agreement, which begins Saturday, Canada would provide 15,000 slots for migrants to enter legally over the next year on a humanitarian basis from the Western Hemisphere.\n",
      "Mr. Biden later took questions from journalists during a joint news conference alongside Mr. Trudeau. The Canadian leader was capping the visit by holding a gala event honoring the president before Mr. Biden returned to his home in Wilmington, Del.\n",
      "The meetings in the Canadian capital followed Chinese President Xi Jinping's talks this week in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Both Messrs. Biden and Trudeau have been staunch allies of Ukraine and the White House expressed skepticism about China's interest in negotiating a cease-fire in Ukraine, saying it would provide Russian forces with an opportunity to regroup.\n",
      "\"We've stood together to defend sovereignty, to defend democracy,\" Mr. Biden said. Mr. Trudeau said both the U.S. and Canada \"must stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine with as much as it takes, for as long as it takes.\"\n",
      "On defense, Canada unveiled a timetable on spending plans to upgrade its defense capability in the Arctic, to track and detect threats from Russia and China, as part of the two countries' joint defense of continental aerospace through the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or Norad. U.S. officials pushed Canada to accelerate spending plans, and issue firm commitments on funding sources. Canada said some of the new detection systems could start operating in 2028.\n",
      "Defense of the Arctic has taken on greater emphasis after a U.S. military jet shot down an unidentified airborne object last month over Canada's Yukon territory.\n",
      "Among NATO members, Canada has trailed in defense spending, at 1.27% of gross domestic productâ€”well below the organization's 2% guideline.\n",
      "The U.S. had pressed Mr. Trudeau to have Canada lead an international force in Haiti to deal with domestic unrest in the Caribbean country. Canada said Friday it would contribute about $70 million to help support Haitian police. Mr. Trudeau has said the country, which has a large Haitian Canadian community in Quebec, stands ready to help should the situation deteriorate, but has stopped short of committing to sending troops.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTONâ€”Momentum in Congress to crack down on TikTok is growing after the chief executive of the social-media company failed to win over lawmakers in a marathon hearing, though lawmakers are divided on what path to take .\n",
      "Republicans and Democrats pounced on TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, his company and its Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance Ltd., in the hearing Thursday. Over five hours, lawmakers seemed dissatisfied with Mr. Chew's answers on Beijing's potential influence over the video-sharing app, as well as concerns about the effect that the app's algorithm has on teens and young adults.\n",
      "The TikTok hearing \"left more questions than answers,\" said Rep. John Curtis (R., Utah). \"I don't think any of us walked away feeling that our data is safe or that there is any accountability for TikTok.\" Mr. Curtis hasn't signed on to any bills yet, saying he wants to see details first.\n",
      "Several bills restricting TikTok use through privacy legislation or an outright ban on the app have been introduced in Congress or discussed, but no clear path has emerged. It remained unclear if lawmakers' denunciations of TikTok would result in passing legislation and sending it to President Biden's desk.\n",
      "The idea of a ban started during the Trump administration and lawmakers from both parties have expressed concerns over the platform, which uses an algorithm to show users short-form videos. Last year, Congress passed legislation banning TikTok from federal government devices and some states have made similar moves.\n",
      "In a shift, Democrats who have seemed more resistant to banning the application or taking other actions also signaled they were more ready to join with Republicans on legislation to strengthen the government's hand in fighting potential threats posed by foreign-controlled apps.\n",
      "\"There's a groundswell of support for this, from Americans and elected officials on both sides of the aisle, as we see that this one app gives the [Chinese Communist Party] the ability to control what a generation of kids see and consume,\" said Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D., N.J.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, who has long advocated for a ban or sale of TikTok.\n",
      "\"There is bipartisan, growing consensus to get this app off of U.S. phones before further damage is done,\" said Rep. Ashley Hinson (R., Iowa).\n",
      "House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said he was engaged in talks about legislation with Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Mr. Warner is sponsoring legislation with Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) to give the government broad powers to restrict and even ban foreign-controlled apps that pose national-security risks.\n",
      "\"I think you could find a very bipartisan bill,\" Mr. McCarthy said Friday. \"I know the Senate is working on one but I believe the House will get one done and we'll pass it through.\"\n",
      "The Warner-Thune bill, known as the Restrict Act, would grant the Commerce Department new authority to regulate foreign-owned apps. The White House reiterated Thursday that it backs the legislation.\n",
      "Any legislative steps on TikTok or big tech are tricky, both politically and practically. Adopting new laws restricting foreign apps has its own complexities, including potential First Amendment implications.\n",
      "The hearing also showed growing consensus to take action to amend Section 230, a provision in the 1996 Communications Decency Act that spells out who is legally responsible for content on the internet. It shields social-media companies from responsibility for what is posted on their sites.\n",
      "Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D., N.Y.) hosted a press conference on Thursday with about 20 TikTok influencers and suggested xenophobia against China was at play and Congress should focus instead on addressing broader concerns about social media.\n",
      "The Biden administration recently demanded that TikTok's Chinese owners sell their stakes in the company or face a possible U.S. ban of the app. Mr. Chew told lawmakers he didn't think a change in ownership would improve safety and security, pointing to the privacy problems of U.S. tech platforms.\n",
      "China issued a statement ahead of the hearing saying it would oppose any forced sale of TikTok , with its Commerce Ministry saying that any sale would involve the export of Chinese technology and must be approved by the Chinese government. TikTok executives have said that 60% of ByteDance shares are owned by global investors, 20% by employees and 20% by its founders, though the founders' shares carry outsize voting rights, as is common with tech companies.\n",
      "TikTok has pledged to spend $1.5 billion on a program to safeguard U.S. user data and content from Chinese government access or influence. Lawmakers who favor putting restrictions on the company have said that plan isn't sufficient, saying any Chinese-owned company must comply with demands from Beijing if called upon.\n",
      "Many in Congress said they would back stricter controls on apps tied to hostile governments, but also wanted to enact comprehensive privacy legislation affecting all big tech platforms, not just foreign-controlled ones.\n",
      "\"We must prevent any app, website, and platform like TikTok from ever spying on Americans again and we must provide the strongest protections possible for our children,\" said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.), who chairs the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n",
      "Some lawmakers urged caution.\n",
      "\"Taking a step to ban access to a media platform is a very big step,\" said Rep. Jim Himes (D., Conn.), a member of the intelligence panel. \"Are we going to ban access to Belarusian newspapers, you know? I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm just saying let's slow the feeding frenzy down now and take a deep breath,\" he said.\n",

      "Full text: BROWNSVILLE, Texasâ€”Some 1,000 trucks a day arrive from Mexico at a border checkpoint here near the southern tip of Texas. Their first stop is a white-and-yellow painted metal portal where energy beamed at the trucks produces X-ray images to try to spot fentanyl and other contraband.\n",
      "Such scrutiny is rare. Across the southern border, most U.S.-bound trucks and nearly all passenger vehicles are generally scanned selectively if they are pulled aside. Mexican cartels have long profited from these odds while smuggling fentanyl and other narcotics . Their illicit trade propelled the U.S. to\n",
      "a record of nearly 107,000 fatal overdoses in 2021, the most recent year of full data.\n",
      "The U.S. wants to increase routine scanning of vehicles arriving from Mexico. President Biden called for more drug-detection technology in last month's State of the Union speech and this month's budget proposal, which included $305 million for new inspection systems, including the technology used in Brownsville.\n",
      "Mexican cartels are the main source of illicit fentanyl , producing it in makeshift labs with Chinese chemicals , according to U.S. law-enforcement authorities. Though cartels have many ways to smuggle in drugsâ€”from mailed packages to secret tunnels and pedestrian couriersâ€”authorities said fentanyl is most often hidden in cars and trucks and driven through border checkpoints.\n",
      "\"They're just blitzing the country through the ports of entry,\" said Derek Maltz, a retired Drug Enforcement Administration official who spent 28 years in the agency.\n",
      "The scanners in Brownsville beam energy at a truck in varying levels of intensity. Beaming less energy at the cab allows drivers to stay inside, speeding the process. Directing more energy at the trailer produces an image of the truck that officials can use to spot suspect material within. Sometimes the payload is illicit drugs including fentanyl.\n",
      "Fentanyl's propertiesâ€”it is cheap and extremely potent in small amounts â€”make it ideal for smuggling, drug-enforcement experts said. And the busy southern border, a vital link between major trading partners, sees a flood of cars and trucks crossing each day.\n",
      "\"The sheer volume is one of the biggest challenges that we have,\" said Jody Hardin, executive director for planning program analysis and evaluation at U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Office of Field Operations.\n",
      "The explosive opioid problem and violent cartel crime have heightened tensions between the U.S. and Mexico. Just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, in the city of Matamoros, gunmen from a local cartel in March kidnapped four Americans, killing two .\n",
      "Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has denied that fentanyl is produced in Mexico while touting renewed cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico in attempts to stop the synthetic opioid from flowing north. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas visited Nogales, Ariz., on March 21 to announce busts following a law-enforcement operation aimed at fentanyl trafficking.\n",
      "Mr. Mayorkas said the new law-enforcement operation netted some 1,700 pounds of drugs identified as fentanyl, methamphetamine and cocaine. More broadly, U.S. authorities say they have seen a significant increase in fentanyl seizures in the current fiscal year.\n",
      "Customs officials want to perform more of what they call nonintrusive inspections, which include the multi-energy portals on display in Brownsville, to increase the efficiency of processing the huge volume of vehicles arriving daily.\n",
      "\"At the onset, we saw a drastic increase in narcotics seizures,\" said Tater Ortiz, who directs the Brownsville port of entry. But a string of busts was followed by a plunge in confiscations as smugglers went elsewhere, he said.\n",
      "The scans flag vehicles that need to be more thoroughly checked, Ms. Hardin said. Two other Texas border sites are using low-energy scanning equipment that can peer into cars, she said.\n",
      "The U.S. aims to deploy 123 large-scale scanners along the border by fiscal 2026, growing its ability to perform nonintrusive scans to 70% of cargo vehicles and 40% of passenger vehicles, according to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Historically, the U.S. has only performed such scans on 17% of cargo vehicles and 2% of passenger vehicles, the office said.\n",
      "Adding more scanning technology has to be part of an effort that includes trying to reduce drug demand and the odds overdoses will prove fatal, said David Luckey, a senior Rand Corp. researcher. He co-led a team that produced a report last year for a commission on synthetic opioids that includes members of Congress and law-enforcement agencies.\n",
      "\"There's no silver bullet,\" he said.\n",
      "Outside CuliacÃ¡n, home to the Sinaloa Cartel, the operator of a fentanyl lab and counterfeit pill factory said he isn't bothered by the prospect of new technology. \"They don't stop all the cars,\" he said. \"There are lots of ways.\"\n",
      "He said the price of fentanyl has fallen in recent months from about $5,000 per kilogram to $3,500 per kilogram as more people get into the business.\n",
      "Dr. Rahul Gupta, Mr. Biden's drug czar, said the administration is disrupting the flow of drugs. He cited preliminary federal overdose reports tracking 12-month death totals, month by month, which have recently edged lower. Preliminary numbers through October indicate the U.S. might still record more than 100,000 fatalities for the second year in a row .\n",
      "At the Brownsville bridge, tractor-trailer trucks, many full of auto parts, line up each day in lanes for their scans. Mr. Ortiz, who has served on the border for 32 years, said he doesn't expect a panacea against drug smugglers.\n",
      "\"They always try something new,\" he said. \"So I'm sure we will have troubles in the future.\"\n",

      "Full text: America's biggest cigarette company has a new plan to shift its business toward less-harmful products, after a string of failures. This time, the Marlboro maker says, its plan will work.\n",
      "Altria Group Inc. earlier this month divested itself of e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc., recording a loss of at least $12.5 billion. Altria now has a new lineup of e-cigarettes, heated-tobacco devices and oral nicotine pouches in the works, including the planned acquisition of vaping pioneer NJOY Holdings Inc.\n",
      "Altria said it hopes to take its reduced-risk products overseas and is considering expanding into non-nicotine offerings such as cannabis products or caffeine pouches.\n",
      "\"Previously, we were chasing the market,\" Chief Executive Billy Gifford said in an interview, referring to Altria's past attempts to develop or acquire vaping products. \"You're constantly watching what the consumer is telling you in the marketplace, but none of them were satisfying the consumer enough to ultimately meet all of their needs and desires.\"\n",
      "Now Altria is soliciting smokers' feedback during the development process, and making tweaks based on that feedback, Mr. Gifford said.\n",
      "Altria this week for the first time set volume and revenue goals for its transition to smoke-free products: It aims to increase its smoke-free sales volume by at least 35% over the next five years.\n",
      "Altria agreed to buy vaping pioneer NJOY Holdings earlier this month. PHOTO: Angela Owens/The Wall Street Journal\n",
      "It also wants to roughly double its net revenue from smoke-free products to $5 billion by 2028, including $2 billion from new reduced-risk products.\n",
      "Last year, Altria reported $2.6 billion in net revenue from smoke-free products, nearly all from moist smokeless-tobacco brands such as Copenhagen.\n",
      "Many of the new products in Altria's plan haven't yet been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration and can't go on the market until they are. That process could take years.\n",
      "NJOY is one of the few e-cigarette makers whose products have clearance from federal regulators. But Altria's acquisition must first pass a federal antitrust review. Mr. Gifford said he is optimistic but can't project when the deal would close.\n",
      "Altria's lineup includes two prototypes unveiled this week: a higher-nicotine version of its On! pouch and a device called Swic that heats a single-use metal capsule containing tobacco.\n",
      "The FDA so far has authorized only tobacco-flavored vaping products . NJOY plans to seek authorization for watermelon and blueberry flavors in a new version of its device that uses a Bluetooth connection to authenticate the user before unlocking, according to people familiar with the matter.\n",
      "Altria in 2018 voluntarily pulled its own fruit-flavored e-cigarettes off the market, saying that those flavors were contributing to a rise in underage use. In the interview Thursday, Mr. Gifford said that flavored e-cigarettes help adult smokers switch from cigarettes and that NJOY's locked version would mitigate the risk to young people.\n",
      "Speaking about the company's plans to explore non-nicotine products, Mr. Gifford pointed to people who used to use cigarettes to take a break, reward themselves, multitask or socialize.\n",
      "\"Those consumers didn't stop enjoying those moments,\" he said. \"They replaced it with other stuff. It could be caffeineâ€”anything in that energy space. Some are now using their phone.\"\n",
      "Altria executives said they hope to use non-nicotine products to reach a broader consumer base in similar everyday moments.\n",
      "\"How do you meet them in that moment and fix their unmet needs and desires?\" Mr. Gifford said.\n",
      "Altria struggled for years to develop e-cigarettes that appealed to smokers as U.S. cigarette sales declined. Among the stumbling blocks was trouble recruiting product developers. The company's e-cigarettes leaked. And they lacked the nicotine kick smokers were looking for. Altria closed its e-cigarette business in 2018, shortly before it paid nearly $13 billion for a 35% stake in Juul . The vaping market leader's valuation quickly evaporated .\n",
      "Altria last year recruited Olivier Houpert, an alumnus of Procter & Gamble Co., to be its chief innovation and product officer. Mr. Gifford said he hopes to bring talent from NJOY. And he said Altria is better able to recruit now because of its remote-work policy.\n",
      "He and Mr. Houpert said the company plans to invest in early-stage startups with promising technology and to work with external partners on technical aspects such as electronics.\n",
      "Mr. Gifford served as Altria's finance chief before he was tapped in 2020 to succeed Howard Willard , the CEO who forged the company's ill-fated Juul deal. Mr. Gifford, who grew up outside Richmond, Va., said he began dipping Copenhagen smokeless tobacco on hunting trips with his father.\n",
      "Now 52, he said he exclusively uses On!, Altria's oral nicotine-pouch brand. At an investor presentation Thursday, he had a cinnamon-flavored pouch tucked in his cheek as he fielded questions from analysts.\n",
      "States including California are enforcing bans on menthol cigarettes, and the Biden Administration is moving forward with plans to ban them nationwide . The administration also has said it intends to mandate the near-elimination of nicotine in all cigarettes sold in the U.S. The menthol and nicotine rules would take years to implement. Altria opposes both and has been lobbying for policies that \"support harm reduction and avoid prohibition,\" executives said.\n",
      "Cigarette smoking is linked to 480,000 deaths in the U.S. each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. U.S. health officials have said they want to encourage cigarette smokers who can't quit to switch to less-harmful products such as e-cigarettes.\n",

      "Full text: Global economic growth rebounded modestly this month, although stubbornly high inflation and banking stresses weigh on the outlook.\n",
      "Business surveys published Friday recorded pickups in activity across the U.S. and Europe driven by services providers. Japan saw a similar acceleration aided by the arrival of tourists from China after the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions.\n",
      "Policy makers in the U.S. and Europe in particular are navigating treacherous currents this year. Central banks have kept raising interest rates to cool economic activity and bring down persistently high inflation. But those higher rates are causing pain in the financial sector, including\n",
      "recent failures of U.S. banks including Silicon Valley Bank and troubles for European banks such as Deutsche Bank AG.\n",
      "The U.S. economy showed signs of strength early this year, with a solid job market and increased consumer spending. If banks tighten credit in response to industry stress, though, that could in turn cool the economy and raise the risk of a recession.\n",
      "Confidence slipped at U.S. businesses to a three-month low in March, according to a Friday survey by data firm S&P Global, amid worries about inflation, financial-market uncertainty and higher borrowing costs. But the survey, conducted March 10 to 23, also reported the fastest uptick in business activity in almost a year, suggesting U.S. businesses have so far seen a limited impact from banking-sector stresses.\n",
      "Surveys of European businesses conducted by S&P Global also pointed to a pickup in growth, and the avoidance of a recession that many had predicted when energy prices surged in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago.\n",
      "Rapid rate rises in the U.S. and Europe this past year have jolted the regions' economies, with some banks becoming casualties. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank roiled markets and sent depositors fleeing, stoking fears of contagion. Regulators bailed out uninsured depositors to stave off a panic. In Europe, regulators shepherded UBS Group AG's takeover of longtime rival Credit Suisse Group AG, which had been weakened by years of self-inflicted scandals and trading losses.\n",
      "Central bankers and regulators have said those strains have been contained, but it may take months before confidence in the banking system is fully restored.\n",
      "\"There are good chances to contain this,\" said Jens Magnusson, chief economist at Sweden's SEB. \"We will have weeks and probably months when we will have to be very attentive to any signs of stress.\"\n",
      "In addition to U.S. and European economic resilience, China's abandonment of its zero-Covid policy has pointed to a better-than-expected outlook for the global economy this year. And while recent data points to a pickup in activity within China itself, business surveys also point to positive impacts elsewhere.\n",
      "Japan's services sector grew at the fastest pace since October 2013 as Chinese tourists rushed to take advantage of their new freedom to travel overseas.\n",
      "Stronger growth comes with its own downsides for central bankers who have been busy pouring cold water on the global economy. While the business surveys also pointed to a slowdown in the pace at which businesses are raising their prices, that pace remains very high by historical standards.\n",
      "\"Such stubborn inflationary pressures, fueled primarily by the service sector and rising wage costs, will be a concern to policy makers and suggest that more work may be needed in terms of bringing inflation down to target,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n",
      "When strains in the banking system first became apparent, investors trimmed expectations of future rate rises by the world's leading central banks. But those central banks have recently announced a series of rate increases, with some signaling that there are likely to be more to come given the persistence of high inflation.\n",
      "The Federal Reserve approved another quarter-percentage-point interest-rate increase on Wednesday, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaling that banking-industry problems might end U.S. rate increases sooner than previously thought.\n",
      "The depth of the banking crisis will determine the path of the global economy, economists say.\n",
      "\"If there are no further problems, it's a has-been and the global economy will keep on chugging,\" said Jesse Rogers, an economist at Moody's Analytics. \"If there's broader rot that we're yet to find out about, we're in a recession in the U.S., with most areas of the global economy in recession,\" he added.\n",

      "Full text: SINGAPOREâ€”China's Foreign Ministry criticized the U.S. for targeting TikTok and said Beijing would never require companies to illegally gather data and intelligence from overseas, escalating the debate over the popular app a day after its chief executive was pummeled in Congress .\n",
      "The U.S. has presumed TikTok's guilt and unreasonably suppressed the app, even though the government has provided no evidence that TikTok threatens its national security , Mao Ning, a ministry spokeswoman, said Friday.\n",
      "\"The Chinese government has never asked and will never ask any company or individual to collect or provide data, information or intelligence located in other countries through means that are in violation of local laws,\" she said.\n",
      "The remarks came a day after lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee hammered TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew in a five-hour hearing Thursday. Mr. Chew had sought to allay lawmakers' concerns about the security of TikTok users' data, as well as about whether China influences content that 150 million American users consume , but appeared to change few minds.\n",
      "His job was made harder when China's Commerce Ministry weighed in ahead of the hearing, saying it would strongly oppose any demand that TikTok's Chinese owners sell their stakes, adding that a sale or divestiture of TikTok would require government approval.\n",
      "The travails of TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., have put it at the center of strained ties between the world's two great economic powers. Swelling bipartisan skepticism after the hearing could cloud the app's future in its most lucrative market.\n",
      "Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.) opened the hearing by asking Mr. Chew to state \"with 100% certainty\" that Beijing couldn't use TikTok to surveil Americans or manipulate the content Americans see.\n",
      "Mr. Chew said the company is committed to firewalling U.S. user data from \"all unwanted foreign access\" and would keep content \"free from any manipulation from any government.\"\n",
      "\"If you can't say it 100% certain, I take that as a 'no,'\" Mrs. Rodgers shot back.\n",
      "Mr. Chew said Project Texasâ€”a TikTok proposal to store U.S. user data in the country with oversight by American personnelâ€”addresses the concern that TikTok user data could be accessed by Beijing. He also acknowledged that currently engineers globally could access such data as required for business purposes.\n",
      "His responses did little to damp the fury on Capitol Hill.\n",
      "Rep. Frank Pallone (D., N.J.), the panel's top Democrat, said he wasn't convinced that TikTok's security plans would work.\n",
      "\"I still believe that the Beijing communist government will still control and have the ability to influence what you do,\" he said.\n",
      "After the hearing ended, TikTok spokeswoman Brooke Oberwetter said political grandstanding had dominated, ignoring solutions that TikTok was working on to protect user data and keep content harmful to young people off the site.\n",

      "Full text: TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has kept out of the limelight until recently. PHOTO: Alyssa Schukar for The Wall Street Journal\n",
      "WASHINGTONâ€”TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Zi Chew has navigated both Western and Chinese business over the course of his fast rise to the corner office.\n",
      "That cultural straddle has helped land him the top job at one of the world's biggest tech companies. His background also provided a potential connection with a skeptical American Congress . Many members have threatened to ban TikTok , saying its Chinese ownership poses a national-security threat .\n",
      "But on Thursday, the 40-year-old Singaporean army reservist and former Goldman Sachs banker faced a hostile House panel as he tried to reassure Americans their data is safe and Beijing won't be able to influence what viewers see on TikTok. Hours before the testimony, Beijing said it would oppose a forced sale of the app from its Chinese owners, something the Biden administration has demanded .\n",
      "That amped up the hearing's geopolitical dimensions, thrusting Mr. Chew into the middle of souring U.S.-China relations. House lawmakers then pummeled TikTok's chief executive over the popular app's ties to China.\n",
      "The congressional hearing was peppered with withering attacks on TikTok from both Democrats and Republicans, running more than five hours and underscoring growing concern about Beijing's potential influence over the app.\n",
      "Born and raised in Singapore, then educated in London and at Harvard Business School, Mr. Chew spent some of his early career cutting deals for a venture-capital firm in Asia. He then quickly moved to the C-suite as the chief financial officer of a Chinese smartphone giant at age 32.\n",
      "He runs TikTok from offices in Singapore, but travels often, including frequently to the U.S. He met his wife, a Taiwanese-American who grew up in Bethesda, Md., at Harvard.\n",
      "Relatively unknown for the boss of one of the world's most popular apps, Mr. Chew was sharply questioned by some of the company's more skeptical critics on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Aides to the Republicans who control the committee say there is essentially nothing Mr. Chew can say that would change their minds as they threaten a nationwide ban.\n",
      "In an interview from the company's WeWork offices in Washington, he said he views Thursday's hearing as a chance to explain what TikTok is trying to do, and to get feedback from Congress membersâ€”not a last-gasp effort to save TikTok's American business.\n",
      "\"I look at it as an opportunity to do that, not a do-or-die\" moment, he said.\n",
      "The corporate stakes for Mr. Chew are as high as they get for a CEO facing such an appearance in Washington. Some Congress members from both major parties are pushing for a nationwide ban of the video app, citing national-security threats. The Biden administration is demanding TikTok divest itself from its Chinese parent ByteDance Ltd. or face such a ban.\n",
      "Critics say China could force TikTok to hand over American user data or influence what American viewers see on the app. TikTok has said it has never received such a request and would refuse to comply with one. Mr. Chew took over the top job after Kevin Mayer, a high-profile Walt Disney Co. alum, left his post after three months, while the Trump administration pursued an earlier effort to force a sale of TikTok to U.S. investors. He is a native English speaker who, like most Singaporeans, is of Chinese ancestry. His father worked in construction and his mother in bookkeeping. He said he was uprooted from a modest upbringing at age 12, when high marks on a national exam sent him to an elite high school.\n",
      "Mr. Chew was put on an officer track during his mandatory 2Â½ years of military service. That added 10 years to his eligibility for reserve duty, which ends when he is 50.\n",
      "The hardest physical experience of his life, he said, was the military's five-day survival course in Brunei's jungles. He built a hut, cooked wild yams and trekked 55 miles. At one point during such courses, trainees are given a live quail that they can kill with their hands before skinning and cooking it. In the interview, Mr. Chew didn't want to discuss what he did with his bird.\n",
      "After the military, Mr. Chew attended University College London and remained in the British capital to work as a banker for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Following an internship at Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook and business school, Mr. Chew worked for venture-capital firm DST Global. His high-school-level Mandarin qualified him to be its China-focused partner. In 2012, he visited the Chinese equivalent of a Silicon Valley garage: an apartment in Beijing's university district. Thirty people, including a chef, crammed in to develop an app that suggested news articles to people based on factors such as how much time they spent on previous stories. The company was ByteDance Ltd ., which would later go on to create TikTok. Its founder, a young Zhang Yiming, won over Mr. Chew. He and his partners invested in the company. \"The idea is so simple but so powerful: that you should be looking at content not based on who you know, but really based on your own behavior,\" Mr. Chew said. Another investment Mr. Chew led was in Xiaomi Corp., a Chinese smartphone giant with global ambitions. Xiaomi brought him over first as chief financial officer, and then had him run its business outside China. One thing that stood out among colleagues was his grasp of both Chinese and Western business cultures. \"He's perfectly bicultural,\" said Hugo Barra, a former Xiaomi executive who worked with Mr. Chew. \"That's a critical asset for an executive of a Chinese company trying to become a global company.\" Mr. Chew led Xiaomi to an initial public offering in 2018, but its shares struggled immediately afterward, during a difficult financial period for Chinese tech companies. In 2021, Mr. Zhang, who had kept in touch with Mr. Chew, asked the Singaporean to become the finance chief of ByteDance, which in addition to TikTok operates other popular Chinese apps. Mr. Chew did that for two months until he and the founder decided he would be better off running TikTok. TikTok has rolled out billions of dollars of spending aimed at siloing off the app from its Chinese owners, and it said it would hire Oracle Corp. to independently monitor against any interference by Beijing. The measures amount to what the company says is an unprecedented effort to assure Americans their data is safeâ€”one that keeps TikTok unprofitable for now. TikTok faces the ban from Washington while it continues to be hugely popular across the country. Mr. Chew, in his own TikTok video on Tuesday, appealed directly to American users, calling attention to the possible ban.

      "Mr. Chew said he accepted the commerce committee's invitation because he wanted to address misconceptions about TikTok, both to Congress and the American public. \"There are some things [being said] that are outright just wrong about our company, and we do need to clarify it,\" he said in the interview.\n",
      "In his testimony Thursday, he said TikTok acknowledged the security concerns that Congress members raised. \"Our approach has never been to dismiss or trivialize any of these concerns,\" he said. \"We have addressed them with real action.\"\n",
      "Rep. Frank Pallone (D., N.J.), the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, issued a blunt response to Mr. Chew's claims. \"I don't buy it,\" Mr. Pallone said.\n",

      "Full text: Ford Motor Co. plans to build 500,000 electric trucks a year at its forthcoming manufacturing complex in Tennessee, one of the auto maker's largest commitments yet to expanding battery-powered options in the highly competitive pickup-truck market .\n",
      "The Dearborn, Mich., car company said Friday it plans to start production of its next-generation electric truck in 2025 at a new factory campus, called Blue Oval City, located about 50 miles from Memphis. This truck will follow the rollout last year of the Ford F-150 Lightning, an all-electric version of its bestselling full-size pickup.\n",
      "The 500,000-truck production target for Tennessee represents a significant step up in manufacturing capacity for the company's line of pickup trucks, historically among its biggest moneymakers. Last year, Ford built about one million trucks overall at several plants in North America.\n",
      "It also comes as other car companies, including crosstown rival General Motors Co. and electric-vehicle leader Tesla Inc., are rushing to put out their own battery-powered trucks, filling a market niche that has seen a surge in consumer demand in recent years.\n",
      "Chief Executive Jim Farley said the new factory would add to Ford's existing truck-building capacity and is needed because the company expects to win over new buyers with the next-generation EV pickup.\n",
      "With the Lightning, 70% to 80% of customers are new to Ford, he added.\n",
      "Ford has twice increased production of the Lightning truck as it has worked to fill a backlog of orders.\n",
      "The auto maker is investing heavily to build new factories, including those that make batteries, and expand its lineup of electric offerings, pledging to produce two million EVs annually by 2026.\n",
      "Right now, the expenditures are becoming a drag on the company's bottom line. On Thursday, Ford said its ambitions to scale EV sales and production led to a $2.1 billion pretax loss in 2022 for its electric-vehicle unit. It projects to post a $3 billion operating loss on its EV business this year.\n",
      "The 3,600-acre Blue Oval City campus, which includes a battery plant and an auto assembly factory , is core to Ford's efforts to become the top seller in the electric-vehicle space, a crown long held by Tesla. Together with South Korean battery maker SK On, the two companies are spending $5.6 billion on the complex.\n",
      "When fully operational, it will employ about 6,000 people, the company said Friday.\n",
      "Mr. Farley declined to say whether workers at the Tennessee complex would be unionized, only that the decision would be up to the employees. Hourly workers at Ford's other U.S. factories are represented by the United Auto Workers union.\n",
      "Ford sells two other EVs now: a plug-in commercial van and the Mustang Mach-E SUV. Last year, it sold about 61,000 EVs in the U.S.\n",
      "The company has joined with SK to produce batteries for the Lightning truck, as well as the next-generation pickup.\n",
      "While sales of the F-150 Lightning have been brisk, the car company recently ran into challenges at its factory in Dearborn, Mich., where it makes the truck.\n",
      "Ford had to suspend production there for five weeks in February and March as it investigated an electric truck that caught fire in a holding lot.\n",
      "The auto maker said the root cause was an internal battery short circuit that occurred when the vehicle was at a high state of charge. It recalled 18 Lightning trucks with the defective batteries in early March and said the problem was limited to batteries built within a certain time frame.\n",
      "Ford is among a number of auto makers shelling out billions of dollars to build EV plants and battery factories in the U.S., a trend that has been accelerated by new incentives offered under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n",
      "Much of that investment is flowing to Southern states such as Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina, which have lower energy costs and more turnkey construction sites.\n",
      "In addition to the complex in Tennessee, Ford is building two battery factories in Kentucky with SK.\n",

      "Full text: SEOULâ€”South Korea's LG Energy Solution Ltd. said it would invest about $5.6 billion in a battery-manufacturing complex in Arizona, the latest in a string of new plants by foreign companies as the U.S. transitions toward cleaner fuels.\n",
      "LG Energy said Friday that the new battery complex in Queen Creek, Ariz., will mainly serve electric-vehicle makers in North America.\n",
      "The amount is about four times larger than what the firm had initially pledged when it first revealed plans last year to manufacture cylindrical batteries for electric vehicles in Arizona, though the project had been up in the air until Friday's announcement. LG Energy said in June 2022 that it was reassessing its investment options due to unprecedented economic conditions. Inflation has been driving up the costs of raw materials and other expenses for manufacturers worldwide.\n",
      "The complex announced Friday will consist of two battery plants and mark the largest investment ever for a stand-alone battery-manufacturing facility in North America, LG Energy said.\n",
      "LG Energy's announcement comes as battery makers have been pushing to build up a bigger production base in the U.S., which is looking to strengthen its local supply chains and reduce reliance on China while speeding up shifts to green technologies.\n",
      "The Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act has offered billions of dollars in tax credits for EVs sold in the U.S., but only applies if they have a certain value of their battery components assembled in North America.\n",
      "LG Energy said the Arizona plant will meet the eligibility requirements of the EV tax-credits program under the IRA.\n",
      "\"We believe it's the right move at the right time in order to empower [the] clear energy transition in the U.S.,\" LG Energy Chief Executive Kwon Young-soo said.\n",
      "The EV tax-credits program has stoked complaints from foreign car makers, but has opened business opportunities for non-Chinese battery players including South Korea's LG Energy, Samsung SDI Co. and SK On Co. as well as Japan's Panasonic Holdings Corp., which have all announced plans for new manufacturing plants in the U.S., including many via joint partnership with auto makers.\n",
      "LG Energy is the world's second-largest producer of EV batteries after China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., and has been seeking growth in the U.S. , where it has seen a boost from Washington's legislation intended to subsidize clean-energy industries and to reduce economic dependence on China.\n",
      "When excluding China's CATL, LG Energy is the top battery maker globally, accounting for 21% of the combined EV and energy-storage-system battery market by units sold last year, according to Seoul-based market-research firm SNE Research.\n",
      "In addition to the Arizona complex, LG Energy is working to expand its battery-manufacturing base across North America. It has three plants it has built or is building across the U.S. with General Motors Co. as well as one planned plant with Honda Motor Co. in Ohio and one with Stellantis NV in Canada.\n",
      "For the coming Arizona complex, the South Korean battery maker plans to spend roughly $3.2 billion on one plant for building cylindrical batteries serving electric vehicles with a production capacity of 27 gigawatt-hours. It is expected to start mass production in 2025.\n",
      "The remaining amount will be spent on another plant for producing lithium-iron-phosphate pouch-type batteries used for energy storage systems, with a capacity of 16 gigawatt-hours. It is expected to start mass production in 2026, according to LG Energy.\n",

      "Full text: Manipulation of earnings from Corporate America is on the rise, an ominous omen for the U.S. economy.\n",
      "That is the conclusion of new research on accounting fraud, using a technique that flagged Enron as an earnings manipulator several years before the energy company's spectacular 2001 implosion.\n",
      "Unless you study accounting, you have likely never come across the M-Score, which is the number underlying both the Enron episode and the economywide concern now. The \"M\" is for manipulation, and uses a company's financial statements to determine whether it is engaging in manipulation.\n",
      "Since the 1990s, the metric has been used to identify red flags at individual companies. Now Messod D. Beneish, a professor of accounting at Indiana University who developed the M-Score in the 1990s, and several co-authors have calculated an aggregate score for nearly 2,000 companies. It shows a disturbing pattern in the historical data: The probability of manipulation usually rises rapidly in the quarters before the economy tips into recession.\n",
      "\"We think this is a measure of misinformation in the economy,\" said Dr. Beneish. The new aggregate measure was published in a December paper, and the latest dataâ€”compiled in March and shared with The Wall Street Journalâ€”shows that the collective probability of fraud across major companies is the highest in over 40 years.\n",
      "The M-Score is calculated from eight ratios on a company's balance sheet, all numbers that public companies report quarterly, and comparing the ratios to earnings statements from a year earlier.\n",
      "For example, one of the eight metrics raises a flag if a company abruptly starts reporting more \"receivables,\" that is, more money owed to the firm but not yet paid. Another flag goes up if a company reports higher values of assets that cannot be sold, and that aren't clearly identified as plants, property or equipment. A third metric looks at changes in accruals, which is when an expense has been incurred, but not yet paid. Another identifies whether companies change how much depreciation they take.\n",
      "There are ways for companies to manipulate all these metrics to appear profitable even when actual sales aren't improving.\n",
      "Of course, there could be legitimate reasons for any of these. A customer might have placed a large order toward the end of the quarter, yet won't pay until early in the next quarter. A drug company might have purchased a major patent, which isn't easily sold. It isn't a factory, but it is genuinely very valuable.\n",
      "But collectively, if these metrics are moving in the wrong direction, it suggests funny business.\n",
      "The M-Score's most famous moment came when it was revealed that three years before Enron's collapse , a group of students at Cornell University's business school, under accounting professor Charles Lee, used Dr. Beneish's model to flag that Enron \"may be a company manipulating its earnings.\" Though their report was posted online, it received little attention until after Enron's collapse.\n",
      "The model also flagged the German payment-processor Wirecard AG . Its spectacular collapse after accounting fraud was exposed in 2020 drew comparisons with Enron. On June 17 that year, the firm was valued at $14 billion, and eight days later it filed for the equivalent of bankruptcy. Dr. Lee noted that the M-Score also flagged strange accounting at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. before an accounting scandal at the chain in 2004 .\n",
      "Dr. Lee, now a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, says that any of the eight metrics wouldn't necessarily mean trouble. But when the score of the combined metrics is rising, it shows \"a growth company, with core businesses that are eroding, that is running out of economic steam and using aggressive accounting,\" he said. Even if the accounting is legitimate, he added, \"you may want to avoid that company.\"\n",
      "Similar scores have been popular in accounting since the late 1960s. There is the Altman Z-score , created in 1968 by Edward Altman, for predicting whether companies are at risk of bankruptcy, and the Dechow F-Score, from the University of Southern California's Patricia Dechow, designed to predict accounting misstatements .\n",
      "Models such as the M-Score aren't necessarily smoking guns. They will sometimes flag legitimate businesses, especially with mergers and acquisitions. Strange shifts occur when companies absorb each other. They are, though, a reason to look more closely.\n",
      "\"You cannot take it to court and say, 'Look, this company has a big M-Score and must be a fraud,' \" said Dr. Lee. \"But statistically, this fits the profile of a manipulator.\"\n",
      "In aggregate, when more firms are reporting sales that haven't actually been completed, declining asset quality or any of the other indicators, it likely indicates that something in the economy is beginning to go wrong.\n",
      "And there is no shortage of signs of strain in the economy right now. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, several high-profile banks have collapsed, manufacturing activity has slowed and home prices are declining. Still, there is reason to think that the M-Score has something to add to the traditional numbers used to take stock of economic activity.\n",
      "False information on balance sheets has \"real economic effects because it represents misinformation on which firms base their investment, hiring, and production decisions,\" Dr. Beneish and his co-authorsâ€”David Farber of Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis and Matthew Glendening and Kenneth Shaw, both of the University of Missouriâ€”wrote in December.\n",
      "The theory is that their index might be catching distress in the stages when some companies are taking steps to try to cover it up. That is when conditions on the ground are beginning to deteriorate, but firms are continuing to report strong earnings. The stock market might behave like the corporate sector is still humming along when in reality, its earnings are increasingly buoyed by tricks.\n",
      "The scholars' aggregate index is too new to have much of a record. Financial history is littered with recession predictors that worked great using historical data that promptly failed when used to predict the future. It didn't work \"out of sample,\" as statisticians would say. So, it remains to be seen how useful the aggregate M-Score will be.\n",

      "Full text: Hedge funds that bet on big-picture market moves have been hit with steep losses as recent bank failures upend bets that interest rates would remain elevated.\n",
      "The souring of the wager led some, including Maniyar Capital Advisors and Haidar Capital Management, to lose more than 20% this month. Many of the funds, which had notched big gains as rates marched steadily upward in 2022, are now flat to down for the year following a steep recent drop in Treasury yields. Trend followers, which try to take advantage of momentum in markets, also were hurt.\n",
      "Some macro funds sustained lesser losses. Bridgewater Associates's flagship Pure Alpha fund had lost a little more than 3% in March through Friday in its higher-volatility share class, while Switzerland-based ED Capital, started by former Moore Capital Management money manager Edouard de Langlade, lost 5%, said people familiar with the firms.\n",
      "Overall, macro hedge funds lost an average 3.5% in the period, according to data from research firm HFR.\n",
      "Macro investors since late 2021 had widely been betting that stubbornly high inflation and a tight job market would cause the Federal Reserve to raise rates faster and for longer than previously expected. Instead, recent banking turmoil put a dent in rate expectations, with the yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note notching its largest weekly decline since 1987 last week. Yields fall as bond prices rise.\n",
      "Bonds also surged overseas. Traders say losses funds were taking on their bets against Treasurys spread to Japanese government bonds as managers unwound similar bets in efforts to curb losses.\n",
      "Many of the funds use leverage, or borrowed money, to amplify their bets, which can boost gains if the wagers pay off but prove costly if they sour. \"The magnitude of the losses really boils down to the fact that this was a levered trade that abruptly unwound,\" said Greg Dowling, chief investment officer of investment-consulting firm Fund Evaluation Group.\n",
      "In the span of some 48 hours in early March, Silicon Valley Bank's collapse changed investors' expectations about the path of interest rates in the U.S., Mr. Dowling said. Where investors previously expected that the Federal Reserve would continue to raise rates, they suddenly were confronted with the possibility that the central bank would ease up, fearing a banking crisis could tip the U.S. economy into recession. Such regime shifts are usually accompanied by months of changing data and messaging from the Fed.\n",
      "The Fed on Wednesday approved a quarter-percentage-point rate increase but signaled it might be done tightening sooner than previously expected, causing Treasury yields to slip further.\n",
      "London-based Maniyar, a macro hedge fund partly owned by Paul Tudor Jones, lost 22% for the month through Friday, according to people familiar with the firm. Haidar's Jupiter fund, which gained 193% in 2022, lost 32% for the period, said a person familiar with the firm. Bloomberg News earlier reported Haidar's loss.\n",
      "Among trend followers, which also profited by betting on higher rates last year, the Tactical Trend fund of the $18 billion Graham Capital Management lost about 10% for the month through Friday, said people familiar with the firm. Stockholm-based Lynx Asset Management's diversified trend-following strategy, the Lynx Program, also lost roughly 10% for the period.\n",
      "Rob Christian, investment chief at K2 Advisors, a Franklin Templeton unit that invests more than $10 billion of client money in hedge funds, said some giveback of outsize gains was to be expected for trend followers, officially known as commodity trading advisers. \"I always tell people you have to have an iron stomach to invest in CTAs,\" he said.\n",
      "A rare fund that profited is $1 billion Key Square Capital Management, based in Greenwich, Conn. In a March 13 investor letter, founder Scott Bessent, a former investment chief for George Soros, wrote that Key Square the prior week had increased its funds' exposures to gold and haven currencies, shorted bank stocks and pulled back on energy exposure. Mr. Bessent since late last year had warned his clients that banks could face losses in their fixed-income and structured-products portfolios.\n",
      "A person familiar with the firm said Key Square's main hedge fund was up 2.5% for the month through Friday. Another fund employing more leverage had gained 5%.\n",

      "Full text: TOKYO -- Toshiba Corp. said it agreed to a $15 billion deal to take the company private, a move that would end years of conflict with foreign shareholders and put the company under full Japanese control.\n",
      "Toshiba said the buyout would be led by Japan Industrial Partners Inc., a Tokyo-based investment fund, and would include 17 domestic companies and six banks.\n",
      "A former leader of Japan's corporate world, Toshiba has gone through eight years of turmoil that started with an accounting scandal in 2015 and included the 2017 bankruptcy filing by its U.S. nuclear subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric Co.\n",
      "It has sold many of the businesses that made it a well-known name globally, including laptop computers, televisions and medical equipment. Its remaining businesses include energy systems, batteries and air conditioners.\n",
      "Toshiba has been under strong pressure from overseas investors to consider privatization. Foreign investors took a bigger role in 2017 when they injected billions of dollars to improve Toshiba's balance sheet.\n",
      "However, the buyout offer price is well below what those investors thought they could get a year or two ago, when the stock market was giving higher valuations to semiconductor manufacturers and other technology businesses in which Toshiba is active.\n",
      "Toshiba said the buyers were offering 4,620 yen a share, about 10% above the closing price of 4,213 yen in Tokyo Stock Exchange trading Thursday. That values the company at about 2 trillion yen, equivalent to $15 billion.\n",
      "The offer price was lower than the 5,000 yen a share CVC Capital Partners was informally offering in April 2021 -- a price that some Toshiba shareholders at the time said was too low. That potential deal fell apart as Toshiba said CVC's proposal lacked details.\n",
      "For the nine months to December, Toshiba reported its net profit dropped 27% to the equivalent of about $640 million.\n",
      "Toshiba said the buyout group led by Japan Industrial Partners repeatedly lowered its offer price in recent months as market conditions and Toshiba's business performance worsened.\n",
      "It said this situation \"is not something to instigate doubts about the fairness of the negotiation process\" and doesn't refute the board's position that it exerted itself to get the best possible deal for shareholders.\n",
      "Toshiba said that while the board unanimously agreed to accept the buyout proposal, the price wasn't high enough to make an immediate recommendation to shareholders on whether they should sell their shares to the buyout group. It said a special committee would discuss whether to make a recommendation to shareholders.\n",
      "One of Toshiba's main assets is the stake it retained in its memory-chip business after it sold majority control in 2018. That business, now a company called Kioxia Holdings Corp., had planned an initial public offering that would have been a lucrative opportunity for Toshiba to cash out, but Kioxia put off the IPO after a chip shortage turned into a glut.\n",
      "In March 2022, Toshiba shareholders rejected a management plan to split the company into two parts, reflecting opposition from foreign shareholders including some that wanted the company to be auctioned to the highest bidder. The next month Toshiba put itself up for auction.\n",
      "Seeking to bring foreign shareholders into the auction process, Toshiba added representatives from major U.S.-based shareholders Elliott Management Corp. and Farallon Capital Management LLC to its board.\n",
      "Toshiba received multiple buyout proposals, but it said Japan Industrial Partners was the only bidder with a detailed and workable plan. It said the formal takeover offer was expected to begin in late July pending approval for the acquisition under global competition laws. It said the offer would succeed if more than two-thirds of shareholders agree to sell their shares.\n",

      "Full text: With Washington and Beijing embroiled in an intensifying great-power competition, multinational companies increasingly find themselves between a rock and a hard place.\n",
      "Ahead of this weekend's China Development Forum in Beijing, the mood among the more than 50 chief executives and other senior executives from the U.S. and other countries expected to attend the high-level conference was a mix of anxiety and caution, said people close to the event.\n",
      "Their apprehension reflects the further deterioration of a relationship that for years has been mutually beneficial: that between Beijing and multinationals. For U.S. executives, the stakes of being seen hobnobbing in Beijing are extra high as Washington-Beijing ties fray ever further and just days after U.S. lawmakers pummeled the CEO of Chinese-owned TikTok about potential Chinese government influence on the platform.\n",
      "For many executives, though, the forum is the first opportunity to check out their China operations since Beijing ended nearly three years of Covid-19 isolation â€”and to get face time with the new Communist Party leadership recently installed under third-term leader Xi Jinping.\n",
      "Against the backdrop of increased animosity, though, many corporate participants in the China forum plan to keep a low profile, the people close to the event said.\n",
      "According to a list compiled by the forum's organizers and viewed by The Wall Street Journal, the expected attendees include tech-giant chief executives Tim Cook of Apple Inc. and Cristiano Amon of Qualcomm Inc., and such consumer-goods and pharmaceuticals CEOs as Johnson & Johnson's Joaquin Duato, Pfizer Inc.'s Albert Bourla, Procter & Gamble Co.'s Jon Moeller and Abbott Laboratories' Robert Ford.\n",
      "Ola KÃ¤llenius, chairman of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, and Oliver Zipse, chairman of BMW AG, are also on the list. So are CEOs of energy companies including Wael Sawan of Shell PLC, Gary Nagle of Glencore PLC and Jakob Stausholm of Rio Tinto PLC.\n",
      "The expected attendance of Messrs. Cook, Bourla and KÃ¤llenius were previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n",
      "Representatives for the companies declined to comment or didn't respond to requests for comment. The organizer of the conference didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "Beijing has been holding the China Development Forum annually since 2000 to bring together global business elites and the country's policy makers and to attract and keep foreign investment. During the U.S.-China trade war, Beijing used the forum to encourage corporate participants to lobby Washington on its behalf.\n",
      "This year's forum, to be held at its usual venue of the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, comes as Washington steps up sanctions against Chinese companies and Beijing increases pressure on multinationals to not cross any lines that clash with Chinese positions, such as by declining to use cotton from the Xinjiang region â€”where the U.S. says Muslims are forced to work in internment camps. China has denied forced-labor practices.\n",
      "Some attending this year's forum are scheduled to meet with Li Qiang, the newly appointed Chinese premier, at the Great Hall of the People on Monday afternoon. An unidentified vice premier is expected to give a keynote address on Sunday, according to the forum's schedule viewed by the Journal.\n",
      "Most if not all of the Western corporate participants plan to avoid public engagements for fear of saying anything that might offend either Beijing or Washington, the people close to the event said.\n",
      "\"Trying to get lost in the crowd is not a bad approach,\" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, who will be attending the forum.\n",
      "But Mr. Kennedy said he expects many CEOs to privately impress upon the Chinese officials that \"the risks for Western firms of operating in China are higher than ever.\"\n",
      "Relations between the U.S. and China, the world's leading economic powers, are already strained over trade, Taiwan, technology and geopolitical rivalries. On Thursday, TikTok landed in the middle of it as U.S. lawmakers leveled withering attacks at the app's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, in a hearing that lasted more than five hours. The Biden administration has threatened to ban the app if ByteDance Ltd., its Chinese owner, doesn't sell its holdings. Hours before Mr. Chew's hearing, Beijing said it opposes a TikTok sale .\n",
      "More Western companies are reassessing their operations in China as tensions between Beijing and Washington rise. In addition, China's nearly three years of draconian Covid-19 restrictions, followed by a sudden and chaotic dismantling of the curbs late in 2022, disrupted supplies of goods from a country known as the world's factory floor.\n",
      "In a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China of 319 of its members, only 45% of respondents said they regard China as their primary or among their top three investment destinations , down from 59% in 2019.\n",
      "Some senior economic officials in Beijing have also grown worried about losing foreign investors as the government is trying to reboot an economy battered by the China's self-imposed Covid-19 isolation . For instance, Liu He, until recently Mr. Xi's right-hand economic czar, expressed such concerns to some Western executives at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in January.\n",
      "Also on the list of those attending this year's China forum are Ray Dalio, founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates; Howard Marks, co-chairman of distressed-debt manager Oaktree Capital; and Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara, CEO of Singaporean sovereign-wealth fund Temasek Holdings. Bridgewater and Oaktree didn't respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "A Temasek spokesperson confirmed its CEO's attendance. \"As an institution, we take part in forums globally for insights on the latest developments, and to exchange views with other investors and stakeholders,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\n",
      "While expressing desire to keep attracting foreign investment, Beijing has appeared to continue its pressure on multinationals. Earlier this month, for instance, it suspended the operations of Deloitte's Beijing office for three months and imposed an unprecedented fine, totaling about $31 million, over alleged lapses in its auditing work of state-owned China Huarong Asset Management Co.\n",
      "By comparison, Huarong itself and seven of its subsidiaries were fined about $14,500 each.\n",
      "Deloitte said it respected the penalty decision.\n",
      "Sharon Thorne, global board chair of Deloitte, is listed as a participant in the China forum.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTON -- U.S.-China relations were rocked again Thursday as House lawmakers pummeled TikTok's chief executive over the popular app's ties to China, and as Beijing said it would fight any U.S. attempt to force the company's sale by its Chinese owners.\n",
      "The congressional hearing, peppered with withering attacks on TikTok from both Democrats and Republicans, ran more than five hours and underscored increasing concerns over Beijing's potential influence over the app. It comes as relations between the U.S. and China are frayed over trade, Taiwan, technology and geopolitical rivalries.\n",
      "TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew, seated in front of U.S. TikTok executives and popular stars on the platform, sought to reassure lawmakers that TikTok would earn their trust. \"Our approach has never been to dismiss or trivialize any of these concerns. We have addressed them with real action,\" he said.\n",
      "Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, gave a blunt response to Mr. Chew's claims. \"I don't buy it,\" Mr. Pallone said.\n",
      "The committee's Republican chairwoman, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, called for banning the app, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd.\n",
      "The bipartisan skepticism further clouded the future of a platform that TikTok has said is used by 150 million people in the U.S.\n",
      "Hours before the hearing, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would \"firmly oppose\" the Biden administration's recent demand that TikTok's Chinese owners sell their stakes or face a ban. U.S. lawmakers pointed to that statement as evidence that the company was beholden to Beijing.\n",
      "TikTok's travails have put it at the center of fraying ties between the world's two great economic powers as they quarrel over trade policy, surveillance, technological development and more. Washington stepped up sanctions against Chinese companies and Beijing deployed regulatory enforcement and other pressure tactics against U.S. businesses.\n",
      "The resulting trade blacklists have swept up China-based telecommunications companies Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., as well as U.S. defense contractors Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Technologies Corp.\n",
      "\"The TikTok battles are indicative of the end of an era,\" said Lindsay Gorman, senior fellow for emerging technologies at the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, and a former Biden White House adviser. \"This era where U.S.-China business relations can continue absent considerations of geopolitics is over.\"\n",
      "The U.S.'s concerns over TikTok partly stem from increased involvement in business activities by the Chinese government. Under President Xi Jinping, China's party-state adopted laws and regulations to ensure its access to data collected by private firms and expanded efforts to influence corporate governance and decision making.\n",
      "China blocked U.S. social media and information sites including Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook.\n",
      "A fund backed by China's cybersecurity watchdog holds a 1% stake in the core subsidiary of TikTok's Chinese parent, ByteDance, a so-called golden share that gives the regulator a board seat at the subsidiary, voting power and sway over its business decisions.\n",
      "Under questioning from Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R., Texas), Mr. Chew said that under the company's security plan, TikTok's data would be stored in the U.S. and controlled by a U.S. company.\n",
      "Mr. Crenshaw responded: \"I want to say this to all the teenagers out there and TikTok influencers who think we're just old and out of touch and . . . . trying to take away your favorite app. You may not care that your data is being accessed now, but it will be one day when you do care about it.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Rodgers opened the questioning Thursday by asking Mr. Chew to state \"with 100% certainty\" that the Chinese government couldn't use TikTok or its parent company, ByteDance, to surveil Americans or manipulate the content Americans see.\n",
      "Mr. Chew said TikTok is committed to firewalling U.S. user data from \"all unwanted foreign access\" and would keep content \"free from any manipulation from any government.\"\n",
      "\"If you can't say it 100% certain, I take that as a 'no,'\" Mrs. Rodgers shot back. \"I have zero confidence in your assertion that ByteDance and TikTok are not beholden\" to the Chinese Communist Party.\n",
      "In his testimony, Mr. Chew said TikTok is spending $1.5 billion to create the firewall, leaving \"American data stored on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel.\"\n",
      "When that process is complete, he said, it should eliminate lawmakers' concern that some TikTok user data could be subject to Chinese law -- though he said engineers globally could access it as required for business purposes.\n",
      "Asked about a possible sale, Mr. Chew said he doesn't think a change in ownership would improve safety and security, pointing to the privacy problems of U.S. tech platforms. He said the platform would work to ensure a safe environment for young people, another concern of committee members.\n",
      "Rep. Bob Latta (R., Ohio) said TikTok had been insulated from legal claims arising from the death of a 10-year-old girl who participated in a breath-holding challenge that was popular on TikTok. Mr. Latta questioned why TikTok should be protected by federal law shielding websites when it amplifies \"dangerous and life-threatening content to children.\"\n",
      "Mr. Chew said the platform has taken a number of proactive steps to better protect children -- including measures that go beyond those employed by other platforms. For example, accounts registered to teens under 16 are set to private by default, and they can't send direct messages. Their content is ineligible for recommendation in the app's popular \"For You\" tab. He said dealing with harmful content was an industrywide challenge.\n",
      "Some lawmakers asked Mr. Chew if he agreed that China's government has persecuted the Uyghur ethnic group, which U.S. officials have characterized as a genocide. Mr. Chew answered by saying content about that issue was available on TikTok.\n",
      "After the hearing ended, TikTok spokeswoman Brooke Oberwetter said in a statement that political grandstanding had dominated the hearing, ignoring the solutions TikTok was working on to protect user data and keep content harmful to young people off the site.\n",
      "The hearing shed little light on how Congress might address the numerous problems with TikTok that lawmakers highlighted.\n",
      "Several bills are under consideration in Congress that would ban TikTok outright, typically by banning U.S. companies from doing business with it. Some would allow the government to ban or restrict other apps with ties to hostile foreign governments. Several lawmakers urged renewed consideration of comprehensive privacy legislation.\n",
      "A ban on TikTok faces practical and legal hurdles, and two federal judges struck down former President Donald Trump's earlier attempts to do so. Any crackdown carries political risks, particularly for Democrats who tend to get more support from the younger people who are TikTok's dominant audience.\n",

      "Full text: Electric vehicles are taking General Motors Co.'s cyber chief into new territory.\n",
      "Kevin Tierney, the auto maker's chief cybersecurity officer, often finds himself monitoring risks across information-technology systems, autonomous vehicles and manufacturing plants. Now, he's adding power-grid security to his day-to-day work.\n",
      "His added brief is mostly due to the sweeping shift away from gas-powered cars. California, among several states, has mandated zero-emission vehicles by 2035, and GM is significantly upgrading its EV production capacity, including with a $650 million investment in Lithium Americas Corp. as part of a plan to develop a mine in Nevada and secure access to a mineral key to the batteries used in EVs. The company plans to release several new electric models this year, and aims to install thousands of charging stations across the U.S. by 2025.\n",
      "\"We're moving, really, from just being a vehicle manufacturer to a vehicle manufacturer and infrastructure provider,\" Mr. Tierney said.\n",
      "That, in turn, creates new cyber risks. Research funded by the Energy Department, published in July, found that hackers could use vulnerable security at charging stations to skim credit-card details and even hijack entire charging networks. Hackers have shown a willingness to target the U.S. power grid, and a string of physical attacks have also disrupted operations. The cyber vulnerabilities of EV and energy security have gained attention in Washington. In October, the Office of the National Cyber Director held a meeting on the subject of EV security. The U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources hosted a hearing Thursday on cybersecurity in the energy sector.\n",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Tierney was appointed to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's cybersecurity advisory committee, a group of private-sector specialists from companies across critical infrastructure operators that advises CISA Director Jen Easterly.\n",
      "Mr. Tierney said public-private partnerships designed to draw on specialists across sectors will be critical. Given that GM's operations cross into advanced manufacturing, transportation and now energy distribution, he said, cyber resilience means companies need to cooperate on core issues. \"I think we have to figure out a little bit better, across sectors, where our touch points are and where we can make our forces more cumulative, instead of maybe doing the same things over and over again,\" he said.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTON -- Top progressive Democrats said they have disagreements with President Biden but remain staunch supporters headed into the 2024 election, after moves by the administration on issues such as crime, immigration and energy policy angered the party's left wing.\n",
      "Mr. Biden sided with Republicans on overturning Washington, D.C.'s crime code, prompting howls from progressives for stepping on home rule, and the White House has drawn scrutiny for considering a return to a policy of detaining migrant families who cross illegally into the U.S. The administration also approved the Willow oil-drilling project in the Alaskan Arctic over the objections of environmentalists.\n",
      "Progressive lawmakers and activists criticized the moves, but the blowback has been limited. No major protests have emerged outside the White House, and there has been no talk of a serious primary challenger from the progressive flank. Many see Mr. Biden as critical to winning the coming presidential race and helping take back full control of Congress, even if they aren't always on the same page.\n",
      "\"I'm opposed to the Willow project, which will mean fossil-fuel drilling on federal land, and I do think the president will need to have a bold climate policy to mobilize young voters in 2024,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), a progressive who is considering running for Senate next year. Still, on the presidential race, Mr. Khanna said: \"I'll be backing him enthusiastically.\"\n",
      "Progressives have been the loudest voices within the party on matters including policing, LGBT issues, economic opportunity and protecting the environment. Mr. Biden ran in 2020 as a seasoned centrist but has worked with progressives on many of their priorities -- including passing a bill designed to slow climate change and taking executive action to trim student loans.\n",
      "\"It's no secret that the president wasn't my first choice in 2020,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.) who leads the House progressives. But after working together she plans to support him in 2024. She said progressives will continue to \"push where we need to push.\"\n",
      "A recent NBC/PBS NewsHour poll said that 50% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents think Democrats have a better chance of winning the White House if Mr. Biden is the nominee, compared with 45% who think the party would do better with someone else. Mr. Biden is expected to formally announce he is running later this year.\n",
      "The White House said it is in regular touch with progressive leaders on Capitol Hill. With House Democrats now in the minority, progressives are pressuring Mr. Biden to take more executive actions, bypassing Congress. Staff for the Congressional Progressive Caucus met with the White House's Office of Legislative Affairs on Tuesday to talk about their wish list, which includes a range of demands, from expanding worker overtime protections to declaring a national climate emergency.\n",
      "Last year, progressives pressed Mr. Biden to cancel student loan debt. Ultimately Mr. Biden issued an executive order to cancel up to $20,000 in debt, short of what some progressives wanted. The Supreme Court is expected to decide the fate of the program by late June.\n",
      "Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) both ran against Mr. Biden in the 2020 Democratic primary, proposing student-loan forgiveness and expanded government health coverage. They now back Mr. Biden if he seeks another term.\n",
      "\"I think what the progressive movement in the country has done is to show the political establishment that millions of people are tired of status quo politics,\" said Mr. Sanders. \"Is he doing everything that I would like? No, but I think he has heard that message,\" he said.\n",
      "\"I thought they were wrong,\" Ms. Warren said of the president's recent moves on immigration, drilling and crime, while praising his actions on climate and corporate taxes. \"Joe Biden and I don't agree on everything, but I'm really glad he's president of the U.S.,\" she said on NBC News.\n",
      "The White House cited Mr. Biden's recently released budget, which proposes child care, paid leave and free community college, as showing shared goals. But the White House is also trying to take a tough line on issues such as crime and illegal immigration that Republicans make clear will be a focus in 2024.\n",

      "Full text: Virginia-based power company AES Corp. says it is ready to push the button on a solar-panel order of more than $1 billion if a manufacturer will commit to building a factory in the U.S.\n",
      "If that factory gets built, AES can buy its panels and apply for federal subsidies recently made available to clean-energy developers that use equipment made in the U.S.\n",
      "There is one problem: The government hasn't decided what \"made in the U.S.\" means, and how strictly to define it.\n",
      "\"You can't sign on the dotted line until this is clarified,\" said Andres Gluski, AES's chief executive. The company and two other developers have said they would collectively buy as much as $6 billion in panels from a manufacturer that sets up in the U.S.\n",
      "Just what qualifies as made in America is one of the biggest questions still hanging over the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed in August that offers hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits and other incentives for clean-energy projects. The issue is more complicated than it might seem, given that almost all clean-energy projects require at least some parts that are manufactured overseas.\n",
      "The law is supposed to spur not only the deployment of clean energy but also the creation of domestic jobs and industries to underpin that rollout. So lawmakers sprinkled support for U.S.-made products throughout the legislation -- from rebates for buying electric vehicles that contain significant domestic content to bonus tax credits for solar or wind developers that use enough U.S.-manufactured equipment.\n",
      "\"If we're going to use federal tax dollars, we're going to direct that investment into the United States and create American jobs,\" said John Podesta, senior adviser to President Biden for clean-energy innovation and implementation, at a Houston energy conference in early March. \"We've for too long let our supply chains drift overseas, particularly to China.\"\n",
      "As much as half of potentially $500 billion-plus in investment generated by the Inflation Reduction Act's incentives include some sort of domestic-content requirements or bonus, according to an analysis by research institute Rhodium Group.\n",
      "The money at stake has made defining what it would take to meet those requirements one of the most hotly contested aspects of the law, spurring complaints from governments as well as tussles among companies ranging from U.S. steelmaker Nucor Corp. to power company NextEra Energy Inc. -- all of which are angling for as much of the green subsidies as possible.\n",
      "The details are being completed by the Treasury Department and are expected to come out over the next few months. The rules on one important incentive -- a $7,500 tax rebate for electric-vehicle purchases, if the cars and their batteries meet domestic content and sourcing requirements -- are expected by the end of this month.\n",
      "Meanwhile, many would-be investors are hanging back. In solar, wind and storage projects alone, about $20 billion in investment could be on hold while the government sorts out a variety of tax-credit details, say clean-energy analysts.\n",
      "A big challenge is that much of the manufacturing the law is trying to spur barely exists in the U.S. today, from the silicon ingots and special glass needed for solar panels to the large steel plates for offshore wind arrays. The bulk of those products and components are instead imported from overseas, particularly China.\n",
      "Defining \"made in America\" in a way that excludes most of those imports could mean nobody would meet domestic-content requirements, some green-energy developers say.\n",
      "Take solar projects, which under the legislation could in some cases receive 10% more in bonus tax credits if enough of the equipment by value is made domestically. That incentive has sparked a furious debate over solar panels, which alone can comprise 40% of the total equipment cost of a solar plant and are crucial to getting the bonus.\n",
      "Companies such as NextEra, the U.S.'s biggest developer of solar projects, are urging that panels assembled in the U.S. be considered American-made, even if the ingredients come from overseas. Such a definition would let more developers get bonus credits and encourage the construction of more solar farms, they reason.\n",
      "Companies such as South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group's Qcells unit, which is planning a U.S. factory, disagree. A solar panel shouldn't be defined as U.S.-made if its most important pieces are made overseas, Hanwha said.\n",

      "Full text: CAIRO -- After years of underinvestment in North Africa's energy infrastructure, global oil-and-gas giants from Halliburton Co. and Chevron Corp. to Eni SpA are ramping up their presence in the region as demand from Europe grows.\n",
      "Executives in the industry are betting it is worth drilling again in some of the hardest places to do business in the world as Europe increasingly turns to other sources for its energy needs after shunning its main supplier, Russia, over the invasion of Ukraine. In recent months, a string of European officials have visited the region to help advance talks over potential supply deals.\n",
      "Halliburton and Honeywell International Inc. are hammering out $1.4 billion worth of deals to develop an oil field and refinery with National Oil Corporation in Libya, which has the largest known oil reserves in Africa, according to the chairman of the state-owned firm, Farhat Bengdara. Italy's Eni is planning investments aimed at replacing nearly half of the gas it was importing from Russia with gas from Algeria.\n",
      "Chevron is looking to seal an energy exploration deal in Algeria, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. In January, the U.S. oil major announced a sizable natural-gas discovery in Egypt.\n",
      "\"North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,\" said Geoff Porter, president of U.S.-based North Africa Risk Consulting Inc. But with Europe needing to replace Russian energy, \"this is their moment,\" he said.\n",
      "Western oil executives say they see a more stable political climate in North Africa, especially in countries such as Libya, where fighting between local militias has been subdued in the past two years following nearly a decade of civil war. Many U.S. firms had pulled back from the region, viewing it as politically too risky, to focus on shale production at home. The region's proximity to Europe and massive reserves, with Algeria holding the third-largest recoverable shale resources in the world, also make doing business there worth the risk, they say.\n",
      "At the same time, state-owned firms in the North African region have been eager to strike deals, as they see an opportunity to fill a gap left by Russia and take advantage of higher global commodity prices. Some countries, such as Egypt, are eager to bring in additional revenue from selling energy, as their economies struggle with higher import costs including for food. The Ukraine war has disrupted shipments and pushed up global commodity prices.\n",
      "The Libyan state-owned company is expected to soon sign a $1 billion agreement with Halliburton that will allow the U.S. firm to rebuild the al-Dhara oil field, according to Mr. Bengdara. The oil field in central Libya was destroyed by Islamic State militants in 2015 and is now run by ConocoPhillips and TotalEnergies SE, he said. It would be one of the biggest deals for the U.S. oil-services giant clinched in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years.\n",
      "Halliburton and Total didn't respond to requests to comment. ConocoPhillips declined to comment.\n",
      "Libya's NOC and Honeywell are set to unveil a contract related to the construction of a refinery in southern Libya, Mr. Bengdara and a spokesman for the American firm said. The initial deal, expected to be announced this weekend, is for the design of the plant, the spokesman said, which would be followed by a $400 million pact to build the entire plant.\n",
      "Libya relies heavily on its oil resources for income, although it has struggled for years to turn its own crude into motor fuel, making it largely dependent on costly gasoline imports.\n",

      "Full text: When Yolett McPhee-McCuin saw the Mississippi women's basketball coaching job was open in 2018, she didn't wait for a call. She reached out to the school's search firm and sold herself.\n",
      "\"I'm hot,\" she said. \"And y'all could get me for cheap.\"\n",
      "McPhee-McCuin had turned around Jacksonville University's team from several losing seasons to 24-9. Ole Miss had little to lose, having won exactly one Southeastern Conference game the season before.\n",
      "Five years later, McPhee-McCuin and her No. 8-seeded Rebels engineered one of the NCAA women's tournament's biggest upsets, beating perennial power and No. 1 seed Stanford on Sunday. The Rebels face No. 5 Louisville on Friday in the Sweet 16.\n",
      "While women's college basketball has been dominated by dynastic coaches or those who've played in the Olympics, McPhee-McCuin is \"out of the mud,\" she said. She grew up in the Caribbean nation of the Bahamas, whose entire national population of 408,000 wouldn't quite fill the stands over an eight-game home season of Ole Miss football.\n",
      "McPhee-McCuin had an unremarkable college career -- Miami-Dade Community College, followed by Rhode Island -- then clambered up a splintery coaching ladder to become the reigning NCAA women's tournament darling.\n",
      "McPhee-McCuin's route included crisscrossing the U.S. to unglamorous assistant jobs: a junior college in the Texas panhandle city of Borger, nicknamed \"Booger Town\"; Arkansas-Pine Bluff; the University of Portland (Ore.); Pittsburgh; and Clemson before landing her first head coaching job, at Jacksonville.\n",
      "\"I always use, like, basketball analogies, and I say: For my life, y'all, I never get a wide-open layup,\" McPhee-McCuin said. \"I always have to do a pro-hop or a Euro step to score in life.\"\n",
      "Coach Yo, as she's known, had a knack for connecting with people, though -- precious currency in the player recruitment that drives college basketball. She told the Coach JB Show podcast this week: \"I don't know that I'm ever going to be googly-eyes over the McDonald's All-American. Give me the Wendy's All-American all day, every day.\"\n",
      "It was a journey to an actual fast-food restaurant that helped land one of her most important recruits. Kayla Gordon, a standout at Meridian (Miss.) High in the early 2010s, recalled that she was a homebody with no interest in leaving the state. But Coach Yo wanted her on the team in Jacksonville, about an eight-hour drive away.\n",
      "So one day, McPhee-McCuin surprised Gordon by walking into the Chick-fil-A where she worked. As the two chatted, Gordon said she marveled at the steps McPhee-McCuin had taken: Calling her mom to find out when she was working, making the trip, showing up and showing Gordon how much she valued her.\n",
      "\"I'm like, 'Wow, I feel special,'\" Gordon recalled.\n",
      "Gordon played four years at Jacksonville, leading the team in rebounding her senior year. After school she took two more leaps inspired by Coach Yo: The former homebody went to Europe, playing professionally in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Finland. And Gordon went into coaching. She's now an assistant women's basketball coach at Jacksonville.\n",
      "Ross Bjork, the Ole Miss athletic director in 2018, said that Coach Yo was on Mississippi's list of potential women's basketball coaches -- a list 25 people long. As he interviewed candidates, said Bjork, now Texas A&M's athletic director, a representative of the search firm hired by the school reminded him, \"Hey, don't forget about Coach Yo.\"\n",
      "That representative, now TurnkeyZRG managing director Chad Chatlos, said McPhee-McCuin was, \"just was like a bulldog: 'Put me in front of the AD. I won't let you down.' Yolett just had this perfect blend of being aggressive but being respectful of the process.\"\n",
      "Bjork and an Ole Miss colleague finally set up a FaceTime call with McPhee-McCuin and, Bjork said, \"She, like, jumped through the screen with her energy and passion.\" Coach Yo was also fearless, something he needed in a coach coming into a tough conference for a rebuilding job.\n",
      "McPhee-McCuin muddled through two rough seasons -- 9-22, 7-23 -- before pushing Ole Miss above .500 in 2021, then to the NCAA tournament's first round in 2022. This season, the Rebels narrowly lost against SEC power LSU and defending NCAA champion South Carolina. Then came the second-round NCAA upset of Stanford and a spontaneous celebration by all the people who've been in Coach Yo's orbit.\n",
      "The Bahamas Basketball Federation, for which McPhee-McCuin has coached the women's national team and assisted in coaching the men's team, congratulated her on its social-media sites. College football talk-show king Paul Finebaum had her on.\n",
      "Fellow Bahamian and WNBA star Jonquel Jones of the New York Liberty tweeted a video of herself dancing and saying, \"We just knocked out a No. 1 seed!\" Jones later explained in an interview: \"The Bahamas is a small country, so it's 'we.' We take our wins wherever we can get them.\"\n",
      "Jones -- a four-time WNBA All-Star and the 2021 league MVP -- said that McPhee-McCuin's father, a legendary high school coach named Gladstone \"Moon\" McPhee, \"basically taught me everything I know about basketball.\"\n",
      "There were few games or tournaments for girls in the Bahamas, Jones said, so players had to fit into boys' schedules or train by themselves.\n",
      "As a teenager Yolett woke her father at 5 a.m. each weekday and they would head to an outdoor court to get a workout in. Then she would go home to clean up in time for her mother, Daisy, who was also the school principal, to unlock the school gates at 7 a.m., according to the Mississippi Clarion-Ledger.\n",
      "The Rebels took down Stanford the old-school way: with defense and free throws. Ole Miss forward Madison Scott recalled that Coach Yo had said the key to beating the Cardinal on their court -- the women's tournament awards higher-seeded teams with early-round home games -- was improving on the Rebels' shooting from the line, a dismal 67.3% this season.\n",
      "\"Before we left, we were in Oxford (Miss.) shooting free throws every day before practice, after practice,\" Scott said.\n",
      "It paid off: Ole Miss made 11 of 14 free throws against Stanford. The Rebels won, 54-49.\n",

      "Full text: The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has triggered a debate over the best way to support unprofitable businesses that are developing new technologies.\n",
      "When it comes to innovations aimed at climate change, some say government agencies should play a bigger role.\n",
      "Before regulators took over Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, it stood out as a lender to clean-energy companies such as residential-solar providers and fuel-cell makers, as well as developers of climate-related technologies like low-carbon cement.\n",
      "The bank's loans to startups pale in comparison to the more than $1 trillion invested in such businesses by venture-capital firms during the past few years, according to research provider PitchBook Data Inc. The lender, however, provided an alternative to more expensive and dilutive equity capital, according to investment bankers serving the industry.\n",
      "\"For better or for worse, they played a unique role in the venture-financing space,\" said Jeremy Swan, a managing principal with advisory firm CohnReznick LLP.\n",
      "Silicon Valley Bank's status as a federally insured depository institution has raised the question of whether it assumed too much risk by lending to early-stage and unprofitable startups. With largely unproven products, these companies often lack assets to pledge against a loan and rely on cash from venture investors, creating a mismatch between risk and return for a bank lender, said Bob Bartell, president of risk and financial consulting firm Kroll LLC's corporate finance business.\n",
      "\"It is pretty uncommon for a [commercial] bank to make a loan to an unprofitable business if it is not collateralized by a personal guarantee of a business owner or a corporate guarantee of a larger parent company,\" Mr. Bartell said. Lending without tangible collateral means \"taking equity risk and getting paid debt returns,\" he said.\n",
      "Government agencies, on the other hand, can represent a more suitable source of low-cost capital to risky businesses because the support they provide usually doesn't depend on profits, Arij van Berkel, a senior vice president of Lux Research Inc., said in a webinar hosted by the consulting firm.\n",
      "\"A government, or a government-affiliated organization, [has] other motives for taking a high risk,\" he said. \"For example, they want to meet climate goals or they want to turn their economy into a circular economy.\"\n",
      "Federal agencies provide seed capital that helps entrepreneurs start new businesses. But funding dwindles during the three to seven years it can take for a startup to become attractive to venture-capital and private-equity firms, said Rita Hansen, co-founder and chief executive of Onboard Dynamics LLC. The company develops portable units that help reduce methane emissions during natural gas pipeline maintenance and other activities.\n",
      "Started at Oregon State University in 2013 with Energy Department backing through its Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E, Onboard later received support from angel investors. Still, Onboard struggled to fund operations before private-equity firm BP Energy Partners bought a majority stake in the business less than two years ago, Ms. Hansen said. Onboard had a Silicon Valley Bank account, but the lender considered the company to be too young for a loan, she said.\n",
      "\"The government has an expectation that there's this big safety net of private capital that is going to catch all these new companies, but that's a big mistake,\" Ms. Hansen said.\n",
      "Clean-energy companies deploying proven technologies, such as solar systems, have better chances of benefiting from recently established federal financial incentives in areas such as infrastructure, clean energy and chip manufacturing, said Peter Davidson, chief executive of Aligned Climate Capital, a clean energy-focused firm in New York. Before setting up Aligned in 2019, Mr. Davidson led the Energy Department's loan programs office during the Obama administration.\n",
      "\"There's massive new amounts of government assistance\" becoming available under recently enacted laws, Mr. Davidson said.\n",
      "He cited grants and loans offered by so-called state green banks as well as other federal sources such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Aligned Climate, for example, uses USDA loans to buy solar installations in rural areas.\n",

      "\"The government has an expectation that there's this big safety net of private capital that is going to catch all these new companies, but that's a big mistake,\" Ms. Hansen said. She added that government funding, when available, is often \"competitive and prescriptive,\" leaving little room for a startup to make decisions on how to spend it.\n",
      "Clean-energy companies deploying proven technologies, such as solar systems, have better chances of benefiting from recently established federal financial incentives in areas such as infrastructure, clean energy and chip manufacturing, said Peter Davidson, chief executive of Aligned Climate Capital, a clean energy-focused firm in New York.

      "Ms. Hansen said early-stage startups often don't have the resources to figure out how to tap government incentives and sometimes find the process too cumbersome.\n",
      "\"Nobody in my network of founders has found out yet how to leverage any funding from the Inflation Reduction Act,\" she said, referring to the 2022 law that established and extended tax incentives for clean-energy investments.\n",
      "The recently added government incentives for clean energy didn't focus on early-stage startups, but the situation could change as reducing carbon emissions becomes a more pressing goal, Anthony Schiavo, a research director at Lux, said during the webinar. He said that more nondilutive, direct funding from government sources could encourage venture-capital firms to back less profitable businesses and change their traditional method of building portfolios with the idea of producing one or two very profitable startups to offset many failures.\n",
      "\"The VC goal or playbook was to invest in a lot of companies with the explicit outcome of trying to get to a billion-dollar startup,\" he said. \"I think [this model] is not very good for the sustainable-innovation space. In general, we need some of these technologies to work. We need to decarbonize a bunch of different sectors.\"\n",
      "Ms. Hansen said venture-capital firms turned down her investment pitches many times, telling her Onboard wouldn't produce the return multiples of 10- or 30-times invested capital in the period that they wanted. It's often hard for developers of clean-energy equipment to deliver such returns because these businesses require a large amount of capital, she said.\n",
      "\"We need patient capital that's willing to tolerate lower returns,\" Ms. Hansen said. \"It's hardware that's going to solve the climate problem. It's not software. It's not an app.\"\n",

      "Full text: A federal judge curbed Puerto Rico bondholders' rights to the electric revenue generated by its public power utility, the last major public corporation in the U.S. territory still in bankruptcy after its other public debts were restructured.\n",
      "Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled on Wednesday that utility bondholders' collateral rights don't extend to the current and future revenue of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa. Bondholders were deemed to have a security interest only in certain funds in Prepa's reserve accounts, which represent a fraction of their claims.\n",
      "Judge Swain said that bondholders have only an unsecured claim to the utility's future net revenue, or its excess funds after operating expenses are paid. Further proceedings are needed to value that unsecured claim, which covers the future revenue that would have become payable to bondholders over the life of Prepa's $8.3 billion in municipal debt, according to the decision.\n",
      "Wednesday's ruling grants some legal leverage to the oversight board steering Puerto Rico's finances as it tries to lift the power utility out of a bankruptcy case that began in 2017. The oversight board spokesman said Wednesday it welcomed the decision as \"a significant win for Puerto Rico and its path to reliable electricity and economic growth.\"\n",
      "\"The oversight board is still analyzing the decision in detail to determine the implications of bondholders' remaining claim but will continue to work on resolving the remaining issues of Prepa's debt restructuring consensually,\" the spokesman said.\n",
      "A spokesman for Prepa bondholders declined to comment. A bondholder group had argued in court that its security interest covered the full principal and interest amounts due on their bonds and extended to Prepa's current and future net revenue.\n",
      "Bank lenders owed $700 million and a single bond insurer, MBIA Inc., agreed to restructuring terms for Prepa, but most bondholders haven't. The oversight board has offered a baseline recovery of 50 cents on the dollar to bondholders in the form of cash and new securities, or less than that if they litigate their security interests and lose.\n",
      "The restructuring terms will determine how much 1.5 million residential and business customers will pay for electricity, which costs more in Puerto Rico than in any U.S. state. Energy bills are already a drain on family incomes and quality of life in Puerto Rico and are expected to increase to pay for any long-term settlement of Prepa's debts.\n",
      "The oversight board and bondholders disagreed on how much of a rate increase customers can afford, especially those with lower incomes. Bondholders have argued that Prepa has a history of underestimating its projected sales and of viewing temporary challenges, such as the rise in oil prices, as permanent in order to drive down creditors' claims.\n",

      "Chinese-brokered deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran on resuming ties this month, the emerging Damascus-Riyadh rapprochement, if it sticks, would leave the U.S. on the sidelines again on another major Middle East development .\n",

      "Saudi state television reported Thursday night that negotiations have started with Syria to resume offering necessary consular services for both countries, citing a source at the foreign ministry.\n",
      "Saudi Arabia and Syria cut ties in 2012 over Mr. Assad's response to political protests that emerged from the Arab Spring uprising and his actions in the ensuing civil war. The Saudis helped orchestrate Syria's ejection from the Arab League and funded rebels fighting Mr. Assad's forces for years.\n",
      "The Russian government brokered a preliminary agreement when Mr. Assad visited Moscow last week, said officials from Saudi Arabia, Syria and other Arab countries involved. Senior Syrian officials then visited Saudi Arabia in recent weeks.\n",
      "If a formal agreement is reached, a vote on reintegration of Syria into the broader region and its reconstruction will be on the agenda of the next Arab League summit expected in May in Saudi Arabia, according to Arab officials.\n",
      "Much of the Arab world has moved to set aside the rivalries that plunged the region into chaos following uprisings that began in 2011 and toppled several Middle Eastern governments. Mr. Assad has been in talks with several Arab countries to end more than a decade of isolation, and the Saudi foreign minister recently said the status quo with Syria wasn't sustainable.\n",
      "Iran also encouraged Syria to strike a deal with Saudi Arabia after Riyadh and Tehran agreed to resume diplomatic ties after a seven-year hiatus, said an Iranian official and Syrian government advisers. Other Arab countries such as Oman and Jordan have also backed the rapprochement between Damascus and Riyadh, said Arab officials familiar with the talks.\n",
      "The main focus of the talks has been security, Syrian government advisers said. The kingdom wants to resolve the issue of Saudi detainees who were captured after joining jihadist groups involved in the civil war, these people said. Damascus is seeking Riyadh's help to cut off funding for and recruitment of fundamentalist factions fighting in Syria, the officials said.\n",
      "Any agreement between Saudi Arabia and Syria, brokered by Russia, would represent another splashy diplomatic move by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The 37-year-old who rules the oil-rich kingdom day-to-day for his aging father, King Salman, has reset relations with Washington , long the Saudi's protector in the Persian Gulf, and developed closer relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping since the beginning of the Ukraine war.\n",
      "Prince Mohammed faced diplomatic isolation for several years after Saudi agents killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in an operation that the U.S. intelligence community concluded was ordered by the royal . The Saudi government says that Prince Mohammed wasn't involved and that the perpetrators were brought to justice.\n",
      "Prince Mohammed has tried to avoid being pulled onto any one side since the start of the Ukraine war . He has used the war as an opportunity to forge an independent foreign policy that leverages Saudi Arabia's status as the world's largest oil exporter. The Syria talks come after Prince Mohammed greenlighted a detente with Iran in a deal brokered by China.\n",
      "\"Oil exporters and authoritarian states have more in common than the democratic West, with their use of sanctions and perceived hypocrisy on respect for sovereignty,\" said Karen Young, senior research scholar specializing in the Middle East at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. In the Middle East, she said, \"the general trend is a consensus on noninterference in domestic affairs as a principle.\"\n",
      "Mediating between Saudi Arabia and Syria bolsters Russia's presence in the Middle East. Mr. Putin's air-power intervention in the Syrian civil war proved decisive for Mr. Assad, and he has courted the Saudis, aligning oil-rich Russia with the Riyadh-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n",
      "For the U.S., the deal is a reminder that, while it remains the pre-eminent military and diplomatic force in the Middle East, its influence there is waning.\n",
      "The U.S. still has troops in Syria, where they are conducting antiterrorism operations in the country's southeast and with Kurdish-led forces in the northeast. But Washington has long signaled that it wants to focus more on Russia and China and less on the region's messy affairs, and the shift was illustrated Thursday when The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. will send aging attack planes to the Middle East and swap out the more advanced combat aircraft there now.\n",
      "\"The most important single factor affecting the region is the perception of American withdrawal, which creates a vacuum that other countries can step into,\" said William Wechsler, a former U.S. Defense Department official and now director of the Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs in Washington.\n",
      "The Middle East has undergone a dramatic realignment in recent years. The Saudis patched up a diplomatic spat with Qatar , Persian Gulf countries have begun setting aside longstanding differences with Turkey, and conflicts in Libya, Yemen and Syria have largely cooled down.\n",
      "The U.S. remains engaged in trying to broker a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia , but there are high hurdles.\n",
      "\"After the Saudi-Iran pact and now a prospective rapprochement between Syria and the kingdom, the U.S. is increasingly diplomatically sidelined,\" said Fabrice Balanche, a Middle East-focused assistant professor at the University of Lyon 2 in France. \"Middle East nations are making peace without Washington.\"\n",
      "For Mr. Assad, a deal with Saudi Arabia would be one of the final demonstrations that he prevailed in a grinding 11-year civil war, not just against the rebels but also against an array of foreign actors, including the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, who called for his removal from power.\n",
      "Mr. Assad used a devastating earthquake in his country's north last month to make a push for normal diplomatic relations, visiting Oman and the United Arab Emirates in recent weeks. But he remains a pariah in most of the world, with overwhelming evidence that he used chemical weapons on Syrians and oversaw the killing of tens of thousands of civilians.\n",

      "Full text: Facebook, Google, Snapchat and Pinterest have been unable to vanquish TikTok. Now their investors may be a bit too hopeful that the U.S. government will do it for them.\n",
      "Stocks of the parent companies of TikTok's main U.S. rivals jumped Thursday as Shou Zi Chewâ€”chief executive officer of the red-hot social-media appâ€”was grilled before Congress over a host of issues that are mostly related to the company's Chinese ownership. Mr. Chew's appearance before the House Energy and Commerce Committee came after the Biden administration threatened earlier this month to ban the app if the company's Chinese owners didn't divest their ownership stakes.\n",
      "The Chinese government responded Thursday, saying it would oppose any forced sale on the grounds that it would involve exporting technology that would require government approval. That appeared to increase the likelihood of an outright ban, which would come as good news to the social-media and online advertising giants that have ceded market share to TikTok over the past couple of years as the app has exploded in popularity, now reaching more than 150 million active users in the U.S.\n",
      "Thursday's hearing was further evidence that a social app purportedly used by nearly half the U.S. population doesn't have any friends in Washington. Committee members from both political parties roundly voiced concerns about TikTok's Chinese ownership and expressed strong skepticism of the company's stated plan to hive off data on U.S. users with the help of Oracle.\n",
      "\"Your platform should be banned,\" said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the committee's Republican chair. \"I still believe that the Beijing communist government will still control and have the ability to influence what you do,\" said Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the panel's top Democrat.\n",
      "Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Snapchat parent Snap, Google parent Alphabet and Pinterest have seen their stocks average a 10% gain since March 15, when The Wall Street Journal reported the threat from the Biden administration. That is more than twice the Nasdaq Composite's gains in that time. Together with Amazon, those companies generated more than $380 billion in online advertising revenue last year.\n",
      "But that was up only 6% from the previous yearâ€”a notable slump from the 28% annual growth averaged over the previous five years. So the prospect of having a formidable competitor being taken out of circulation is heartening, especially in a market that isn't expected to turn back up anytime soon.\n",
      "Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik estimates that TikTok is on track to generate between $7 billion and $8 billion in revenue in the U.S. alone next year. He named Meta and Alphabet, which also owns TikTok competitor YouTube, as the companies most likely to benefit from a TikTok ban, but added that \"some ad dollars may just go back into ad buyer pockets or look for an experimental platform outside our cohort.\"\n",
      "Experienced D.C. watchers say it is still far from certain whether such a ban can even be enactedâ€”and if it will stick. \"We remain below 50% that TikTok is ultimately banned in the U.S.,\" wrote Paul Gallant, policy analyst for TD Cowen, in a report Wednesday. Matt Perault of New Street Research notes that TikTok could challenge any ban on First Amendment grounds, which would result in a lengthy court battle at the very least.\n",
      "Mr. Chew may have gotten buried by political grandstanding on Thursday. But for investors, it is still too early to be dancing on TikTok's grave.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTONâ€”Top progressive Democrats said they have disagreements with President Biden but remain staunch supporters headed into the 2024 election, after moves by the administration on issues such as crime, immigration and energy policy angered the party's left wing.\n",
      "Mr. Biden sided with Republicans on overturning Washington, D.C.'s crime code , prompting howls from progressives for stepping on home rule, and the White House has drawn scrutiny for considering a return to a policy of detaining migrant families who cross illegally into the U.S. The administration also\n",
      "approved the Willow oil-drilling project over the objections of environmentalists.\n",
      "Progressive lawmakers and activists criticized the moves, but the blowback has been limited. No major protests have emerged outside the White House, like those seen during former President Barack Obama's administration , and there has been no talk of a serious primary challenger from the progressive flank. Many see Mr. Biden as critical to winning the coming presidential race and helping take back full control of Congress, even if they aren't always on the same page.\n",
      "\"I'm opposed to the Willow project, which will mean fossil-fuel drilling on federal land, and I do think the president will need to have a bold climate policy to mobilize young voters in 2024,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), a progressive who is considering running for Senate next year. Still, on the presidential race, Mr. Khanna said: \"I'll be backing him enthusiastically.\"\n",
      "Progressives have been the loudest voices within the party on matters including policing, LGBT issues, economic opportunity and protecting the environment. Mr. Biden ran in 2020 as a seasoned centrist but has worked with progressives on many of their prioritiesâ€”including passing a bill designed to slow climate change and taking executive action to trim student loans.\n",
      "\"It's no secret that the president wasn't my first choice in 2020,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.) who leads the House progressives. But after working together she plans to support him in 2024. She said progressives will continue to \"push where we need to push.\"\n",
      "A recent NBC/PBS NewsHour poll said that 50% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents think Democrats have a better chance of winning the White House if Mr. Biden is the nominee, compared with 45% who think the party would do better with someone else. Mr. Biden is expected to formally announce he is running later this year.\n",
      "The White House said it is in regular touch with progressive leaders on Capitol Hill. With House Democrats now in the minority, progressives are pressuring Mr. Biden to take more executive actions, bypassing Congress. Staff for the Congressional Progressive Caucus met with the White House's Office of Legislative Affairs on Tuesday to talk about their wish list , which includes a range of demands, from expanding worker overtime protections to declaring a national climate emergency.\n",
      "Last year, progressives pressed Mr. Biden to cancel student loan debt. Ultimately Mr. Biden issued an executive order to cancel up to $20,000 in debt , short of what some progressives wanted. The Supreme Court is expected to decide the fate of the program by late June.\n",
      "Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) both ran against Mr. Biden in the 2020 Democratic primary, proposing student-loan forgiveness and expanded government health coverage. They now back Mr. Biden if he seeks another term.\n",
      "\"I think what the progressive movement in the country has done is to show the political establishment that millions of people are tired of status quo politics,\" said Mr. Sanders. \"Is he doing everything that I would like? No, but I think he has heard that message,\" he said.\n",
      "\"I thought they were wrong,\" Ms. Warren said of the president's recent moves on immigration, drilling and crime, while praising his actions on climate and corporate taxes. \"Joe Biden and I don't agree on everything, but I'm really glad he's president of the U.S.,\" she said on NBC News.\n",
      "The White House cited Mr. Biden's recently released budget , which proposes child care, paid leave and free community college, as showing shared goals. But the White House is also trying to take a tough line on issues such as crime and illegal immigration that Republicans make clear will be a focus in 2024.\n",
      "The Biden administration has crossed progressives on a string of issues in recent months. The administration approved the Willow oil-drilling project in the Alaskan Arctic, arguing it had limited legal options and stressed that the president has moved to block future oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Ocean's federal waters.\n",
      "On immigration, the administration is considering a return to a policy of detaining migrant families as it looks to more restrictive policies to control the southern border. The White House said no decision has been made yet on family detention.\n",
      "On the D.C. crime bill, many Democrats were upset because they felt blindsided. The White House initially said it opposed the bill but then pivoted and said Mr. Biden would sign it. The White House said Mr. Biden never issued an explicit veto threat and emphasized his record of supporting funding for public safety.\n",
      "\"Our view is this is like a family,\" said White House Legislative Affairs Director Louisa Terrell of the D.C. bill. \"We have Democrats on the House side and Democrats on the Senate side, and we are a family, and we have heard this, and we've talked it through, and we're now two weeks later, and we're moving on,\" she said.\n",

      "Full text: TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has kept out of the limelight until recently. PHOTO: Alyssa Schukar for The Wall Street Journal\n",
      "WASHINGTONâ€”TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Zi Chew has navigated both Western and Chinese business over the course of his fast rise to the corner office.\n",
      "That cultural straddle has helped land him the top job at one of the world's biggest tech companies. His background also provided a potential connection with a skeptical American Congress . Many members have threatened to ban TikTok, saying its Chinese ownership poses a national-security threat .\n",
      "But on Thursday, the 40-year-old Singaporean army reservist and former Goldman Sachs banker faced a hostile House panel as he tried to reassure Americans their data is safe and Beijing won't be able to influence what viewers see on TikTok. Hours before the testimony, Beijing said it would oppose a forced sale of the app from its Chinese owners, something the Biden administration has demanded .\n",
      "That amped up the hearing's geopolitical dimensions, thrusting Mr. Chew into the middle of souring U.S.-China relations. House lawmakers then pummeled TikTok's chief executive over the popular app's ties to China.\n",
      "The congressional hearing was peppered with withering attacks on TikTok from both Democrats and Republicans, running more than five hours and underscoring growing concern about Beijing's potential influence over the app.\n",
      "Born and raised in Singapore, then educated in London and at Harvard Business School, Mr. Chew spent some of his early career cutting deals for a venture-capital firm in Asia. He then quickly moved to the C-suite as the chief financial officer of a Chinese smartphone giant at age 32.\n",
      "He runs TikTok from offices in Singapore, but travels often, including frequently to the U.S. He met his wife, a Taiwanese-American who grew up in Bethesda, Md., at Harvard.\n",
      "Relatively unknown for the boss of one of the world's most popular apps, Mr. Chew was sharply questioned by some of the company's more skeptical critics on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Aides to the Republicans who control the committee say there is essentially nothing Mr. Chew can say that would change their minds as they threaten a nationwide ban.\n",
      "In an interview from the company's WeWork offices in Washington, he said he views Thursday's hearing as a chance to explain what TikTok is trying to do, and to get feedback from Congress membersâ€”not a last-gasp effort to save TikTok's American business.\n",
      "\"I look at it as an opportunity to do that, not a do-or-die\" moment, he said.\n",
      "The corporate stakes for Mr. Chew are as high as they get for a CEO facing such an appearance in Washington. Some Congress members from both major parties are pushing for a nationwide ban of the video app, citing national-security threats. The Biden administration is demanding TikTok divest itself from its Chinese parent ByteDance Ltd. or face such a ban.\n",
      "Critics say China could force TikTok to hand over American user data or influence what American viewers see on the app. TikTok has said it has never received such a request and would refuse to comply with one. Mr. Chew took over the top job after Kevin Mayer, a high-profile Walt Disney Co. alum, left his post after three months, while the Trump administration pursued an earlier effort to force a sale of TikTok to U.S. investors. He is a native English speaker who, like most Singaporeans, is of Chinese ancestry. His father worked in construction and his mother in bookkeeping. He said he was uprooted from a modest upbringing at age 12, when high marks on a national exam sent him to an elite high school.\n",
      "Mr. Chew was put on an officer track during his mandatory 2Â½ years of military service. That added 10 years to his eligibility for reserve duty, which ends when he is 50.\n",
      "The hardest physical experience of his life, he said, was the military's five-day survival course in Brunei's jungles. He built a hut, cooked wild yams and trekked 55 miles. At one point during such courses, trainees are given a live quail that they can kill with their hands before skinning and cooking it. In the interview, Mr. Chew didn't want to discuss what he did with his bird.\n",
      "After the military, Mr. Chew attended University College London and remained in the British capital to work as a banker for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Following an internship at Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook and business school, Mr. Chew worked for venture-capital firm DST Global. His high-school-level Mandarin qualified him to be its China-focused partner. In 2012, he visited the Chinese equivalent of a Silicon Valley garage: an apartment in Beijing's university district. Thirty people, including a chef, crammed in to develop an app that suggested news articles to people based on factors such as how much time they spent on previous stories. The company was ByteDance Ltd ., which would later go on to create TikTok. Its founder, a young Zhang Yiming, won over Mr. Chew. He and his partners invested in the company. \"The idea is so simple but so powerful: that you should be looking at content not based on who you know, but really based on your own behavior,\" Mr. Chew said. Another investment Mr. Chew led was in Xiaomi Corp., a Chinese smartphone giant with global ambitions. Xiaomi brought him over first as chief financial officer, and then had him run its business outside China. One thing that stood out among colleagues was his grasp of both Chinese and Western business cultures. \"He's perfectly bicultural,\" said Hugo Barra, a former Xiaomi executive who worked with Mr. Chew. \"That's a critical asset for an executive of a Chinese company trying to become a global company.\" Mr. Chew led Xiaomi to an initial public offering in 2018, but its shares struggled immediately afterward, during a difficult financial period for Chinese tech companies. In 2021, Mr. Zhang, who had kept in touch with Mr. Chew, asked the Singaporean to become the finance chief of ByteDance, which in addition to TikTok operates other popular Chinese apps. Mr. Chew did that for two months until he and the founder decided he would be better off running TikTok. TikTok has rolled out billions of dollars of spending aimed at siloing off the app from its Chinese owners, and it said it would hire Oracle Corp. to independently monitor against any interference by Beijing. The measures amount to what the company says is an unprecedented effort to assure Americans their data is safeâ€”one that keeps TikTok unprofitable for now. TikTok faces the ban from Washington while it continues to be hugely popular across the country. Mr. Chew, in his own TikTok video on Tuesday, appealed directly to American users, calling attention to the possible ban. In the video he said the app had 150 million users in the U.S., almost half the country's population. Mr. Chew said he accepted the commerce committee's invitation because he wanted to address misconceptions about TikTok, both to Congress and the American public. \"There are some things [being said] that are outright just wrong about our company, and we do need to clarify it,\" he said in the interview.\n",

      "Full text: General Mills, maker of Cheerios and other food brands, said consumers have taken higher prices in stride this year. PHOTO: Kristen Norman for The Wall Street Journal\n",
      "General Mills Inc. executives said inflation isn't letting up, but customers are sticking with its products despite higher prices in grocery stores.\n",
      "The Minneapolis-based maker of Cheerios and Betty Crocker cake mix said Thursday that it expects cost increases to moderate but remain above normal in the company's fiscal 2024, which begins later this year. General Mills expects expenses tied to labor, energy and the company's suppliers to keep cost inflation in the mid-single digits, compared with about 14% to 15% this fiscal year.\n",
      "\"The environment remains challenging and dynamic,\" said Jeff Harmening, General Mills' chief executive.\n",
      "General Mills executives said that while prices for some key raw commodities have declined from their recent peaks, costs incurred by suppliers that turn those commodities into products for the company are expected to remain elevated.\n",
      "Still, General Mills said consumers have taken higher prices in stride this year more than they have historically.\n",
      "General Mills on Thursday boosted its outlook for sales and profits after revenue rose 13% in its latest quarter, driven largely by higher prices. The amount of food the company sold globally was flat, including declines in its North American retail and international businesses.\n",
      "Mr. Harmening said consumers are still eating at home more than they did before the pandemic, and that General Mills sees that continuing.\n",
      "Consumers have seen their grocery bills surge as food makers have passed on what executives have said are climbing costs for ingredients, transportation and labor. Higher prices have helped boost sales for food manufacturers such as Kellogg Co. and Kraft Heinz Co., but they have often chipped away at volumes.\n",
      "Containing such rising costs is a central part of the Federal Reserve's efforts to bring down inflation that remains stubbornly high. The consumer-price index, a closely watched inflation gauge, rose 6% in February from a year earlier, down from a 6.4% gain the prior month, according to the Labor Department. It was the smallest increase since September 2021.\n",
      "Food inflation has begun to slow , though U.S. grocery prices were still up 10% in February from a year earlier, the Labor Department said. An index for meats, poultry, fish and eggs fell 0.1% in February, the first decrease since December 2021. An index for eggs alone fell 6.7%.\n",
      "Sales at General Mills' North America retail division, which includes U.S. groceries, rose 15% in the quarter, which ended Feb. 26. The company said its products have gained market share in cereal, refrigerated dough, fruit snacks, soup and seasoning categories this year, as it has ratcheted up marketing spending. Rising costs hurt operating profit in the company's pet food business, though sales in that unit also increased.\n",
      "\"The consumer seems to be reasonably robust,\" Mr. Harmening said.\n",
      "While private-label products, which are typically cheaper than brand-name equivalents, picked up market share during the last economic recession, Mr. Harmening said, General Mills was able to hang on to its share. General Mills' exposure to private-label products remains lower than average, which bodes well for its future, he said.\n",
      "General Mills shares closed 2.9% higher on Thursday.\n",
      "For the full year, General Mills now forecasts organic sales , which exclude acquisitions, divestitures and the impact of currency translation, rising between 10% and 11%, slightly higher than the outlook it gave last month. Per-share earnings are expected to rise 8% to 9% on an adjusted basis, also a slight increase.\n",
      "General Mills posted earnings of $553.1 million, or 92 cents a share, for the most recent quarter, down from $660.3 million, or $1.08 a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings were 97 cents a share, above analysts' estimates of 92 cents.\n",

      "Full text: When Yolett McPhee-McCuin saw the Mississippi women's basketball coaching job was open in 2018, she didn't wait for a call. She reached out to the school's search firm and sold herself.\n",
      "\"I'm hot,\" she said. \"And y'all could get me for cheap.\"\n",
      "McPhee-McCuin had turned around Jacksonville University's team from several losing seasons to 24-9. Ole Miss had little to lose, having won exactly one Southeastern Conference game the season before.\n",
      "Five years later, McPhee-McCuin and her No. 8-seeded Rebels engineered one of the NCAA women's tournament's biggest upsets, beating perennial power and No. 1 seed Stanford on Sunday. The Rebels face No. 5 Louisville on Friday in the Sweet 16.\n",
      "While women's college basketball has been dominated by dynastic coaches or those who've played in the Olympics, McPhee-McCuin is \"out of the mud,\" she said. She grew up in the Caribbean nation of the Bahamas, whose entire national population of 408,000 wouldn't quite fill the stands over an eight-game home season of Ole Miss football.\n",
      "McPhee-McCuin had an unremarkable college careerâ€”Miami-Dade Community College, followed by Rhode Islandâ€”then clambered up a splintery coaching ladder to become the reigning NCAA women's tournament darling.\n",
      "McPhee-McCuin's route included crisscrossing the U.S. to unglamorous assistant jobs: a junior college in the Texas panhandle city of Borger, nicknamed \"Booger Town\"; Arkansas-Pine Bluff; the University of Portland (Ore.); Pittsburgh; and Clemson before landing her first head coaching job, at Jacksonville.\n",
      "\"I always use, like, basketball analogies, and I say: For my life, y'all, I never get a wide-open layup,\" McPhee-McCuin said. \"I always have to do a pro-hop or a Euro step to score in life.\"\n",
      "Coach Yo, as she's known, had a knack for connecting with people, thoughâ€”precious currency in the player recruitment that drives college basketball. She told the Coach JB Show podcast this week: \"I don't know that I'm ever going to be googly-eyes over the McDonald's All-American. Give me the Wendy's All-American all day, every day.\"\n",
      "It was a journey to an actual fast-food restaurant that helped land one of her most important recruits. Kayla Gordon, a standout at Meridian (Miss.) High in the early 2010s, recalled that she was a homebody with no interest in leaving the state. But Coach Yo wanted her on the team in Jacksonville, about an eight-hour drive away.\n",
      "So one day, McPhee-McCuin surprised Gordon by walking into the Chick-fil-A where she worked. As the two chatted, Gordon said she marveled at the steps McPhee-McCuin had taken: calling her mom to find out when she was working, making the trip, showing up and showing Gordon how much she valued her.\n",
      "\"I'm like, 'Wow, I feel special,'\" Gordon recalled.\n",
      "Gordon played four years at Jacksonville, leading the team in rebounding her senior year. After school she took two more leaps inspired by Coach Yo: The former homebody went to Europe, playing professionally in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Finland. And Gordon went into coaching. She's now an assistant women's basketball coach at Jacksonville.\n",
      "Ross Bjork, the Ole Miss athletic director in 2018, said that Coach Yo was on Mississippi's list of potential women's basketball coachesâ€”a list 25 people long. As he interviewed candidates, said Bjork, now Texas A&M's athletic director, a representative of the search firm hired by the school reminded him, \"Hey, don't forget about Coach Yo.\"\n",
      "That representative, now TurnkeyZRG managing director Chad Chatlos, said McPhee-McCuin was, \"just was like a bulldog: 'Put me in front of the AD. I won't let you down.' Yolett just had this perfect blend of being aggressive but being respectful of the process.\"\n",
      "Bjork and an Ole Miss colleague finally set up a FaceTime call with McPhee-McCuin and, Bjork said, \"She, like, jumped through the screen with her energy and passion.\" Coach Yo was also fearless, something he needed in a coach coming into a tough conference for a rebuilding job.\n",
      "McPhee-McCuin muddled through two rough seasonsâ€”9-22, 7-23â€”before pushing Ole Miss above .500 in 2021, then to the NCAA tournament's first round in 2022. This season, the Rebels narrowly lost against SEC power LSU and defending NCAA champion South Carolina. Then came the second-round NCAA upset of Stanford and a spontaneous celebration by all the people who've been in Coach Yo's orbit.\n",
      "The Bahamas Basketball Federation, for which McPhee-McCuin has coached the women's national team and assisted in coaching the men's team, congratulated her on its social-media sites. College football talk-show king Paul Finebaum had her on .\n",
      "Fellow Bahamian and WNBA star Jonquel Jones of the New York Liberty tweeted a video of herself dancing and saying, \"We just knocked out a No. 1 seed!\" Jones later explained in an interview: \"The Bahamas is a small country, so it's 'we.' We take our wins wherever we can get them.\"\n",
      "Jonesâ€”a four-time WNBA All-Star and the 2021 league MVPâ€”said that McPhee-McCuin's father, a legendary high school coach named Gladstone \"Moon\" McPhee, \"basically taught me everything I know about basketball.\"\n",
      "There were few games or tournaments for girls in the Bahamas, Jones said, so players had to fit into boys' schedules or train by themselves. As a teenager Yolett woke her father at 5 a.m. each weekday and they would head to an outdoor court to get a workout in. Then she would go home to clean up in time for her mother, Daisy, who was also the school principal, to unlock the school gates at 7 a.m., according to the Mississippi Clarion-Ledger .\n",
      "The Rebels took down Stanford the old-school way: with defense and free throws. Ole Miss forward Madison Scott recalled that Coach Yo had said the key to beating the Cardinal on their courtâ€”the women's tournament awards higher-seeded teams with early-round home gamesâ€”was improving on the Rebels' shooting from the line, a dismal 67.3% this season.\n",
      "\"Before we left, we were in Oxford (Miss.) shooting free throws every day before practice, after practice,\" Scott said.\n",
      "It paid off: Ole Miss made 11 of 14 free throws against Stanford. The Rebels won, 54-49.\n",
      "Jones said she was moved as she watched an on-court interview where Coach Yo called herself a \"little girl from the Bahamas that was given an opportunity\" and dedicated the win to \"people with a dollar and a dream.\"\n",
      "\"Of course, that's going to resonate with so many other people, not just Bahamians, who have big dreams but they don't necessarily know how they can get from point A to point B,\" Jones said. \"So for her to be able to share those stories is, you know, that's what it's all about. That's what sports is all about.\"\n",

      "Full text: U.S.-China relations were dealt another blow as lawmakers at a House hearing pressed TikTok's chief executive on the popular app's ties to China, and as Beijing said it would fight any U.S. attempt to force the company's sale by its Chinese owners.\n",
      "The hearing Thursday, peppered with withering attacks on TikTok from both Democrats and Republicans, ran more than five hours and underscored growing concern about Beijing's potential influence over the app. U.S.-China relations are already frayed over trade, Taiwan, technology and geopolitical rivalries.\n",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, seated in front of U.S. TikTok executives and popular stars on the platform, sought to reassure lawmakers that the company would earn their trust.\n",
      "\"Our approach has never been to dismiss or trivialize any of these concerns. We have addressed them with real action,\" he said.\n",
      "Rep. Frank Pallone (D., N.J.), the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, issued a blunt response to Mr. Chew's claims.\n",
      "\"I don't buy it,\" Mr. Pallone said. The committee's chairwoman, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.), called for banning the app , which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd.\n",
      "The bipartisan skepticism further clouded the future of a platform that TikTok says is now used by 150 million Americans .\n",
      "Hours before the hearing, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would \"firmly oppose\" the Biden administration's recent demand that TikTok's Chinese owners sell their stakes or face a possible ban. U.S. lawmakers pointed to that statement as evidence that the company was beholden to Beijing.\n",
      "TikTok's travails have put it at the center of strained ties between the world's two great economic powers as they quarrel over issues including trade policy, surveillance and technological development. Washington has stepped up sanctions against Chinese companies, and Beijing has deployed regulatory enforcement and other pressure tactics against American businesses.\n",
      "The resulting trade blacklists have swept up China-based telecommunications companies Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., as well as U.S. defense contractors Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Technologies Corp.\n",
      "\"The TikTok battles are indicative of the end of an era,\" said Lindsay Gorman, senior fellow for emerging technologies at the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, and a former Biden White House adviser. \"This era where U.S.-China business relations can continue absent considerations of geopolitics is over.\"\n",
      "The U.S. concerns over TikTok have partly stemmed from increased involvement in business activities by the Chinese government. Under leader Xi Jinping, China's party-state has adopted laws and regulations to ensure its access to data collected by private firms, and expanded efforts to influence corporate governance and decision-making.\n",
      "China has also blocked U.S. social media and information sites including Alphabet Inc.'s Google and the Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook.\n",
      "A fund backed by China's cybersecurity watchdog holds a 1% stake in the core subsidiary of TikTok's Chinese parent, Bytedance Ltd., a what is called \"golden share\" that gives the regulator a board seat at the subsidiary, voting power and sway over its business decisions.\n",
      "Under questioning from Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R., Texas), Mr. Chew said that under the company's security plan, TikTok's data would be stored in the U.S. and controlled by a U.S. company, alleviating the concern.\n",
      "Mr. Crenshaw responded: \"I want to say this to all the teenagers out there and TikTok influencers who think we're just old and out of touch andâ€¦. trying to take away your favorite app. You may not care that your data is being accessed now, but it will be one day when you do care about it.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Rodgers opened the questioning Thursday by asking Mr. Chew to state \"with 100% certainty\" that the Chinese government couldn't use TikTok or ByteDance to surveil Americans or manipulate the content Americans see.\n",
      "Mr. Chew said the company was committed to firewalling U.S. user data from \"all unwanted foreign access\" and would keep content \"free from any manipulation from any government.\"\n",
      "\"If you can't say it 100% certain, I take that as a 'no,'\" Mrs. Rodgers shot back. \"I have zero confidence in your assertion that ByteDance and TikTok are not beholden to the [Chinese Communist Party].\"\n",
      "In his testimony , Mr. Chew said TikTok is spending $1.5 billion to create the firewall of U.S. data, leaving \"American data stored on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel.\"\n",
      "When that process is complete, he said, it should eliminate lawmakers' concern that some TikTok user data could be subject to Chinese lawâ€”though he said engineers globally could access it as required for business purposes.\n",
      "Asked about a possible sale, Mr. Chew said he didn't think a change in ownership would improve safety and security, pointing to the privacy problems of U.S. tech platforms.\n",
      "Mr. Chew also said the platform would work to ensure a safe environment for young people, another concern of committee members.\n",
      "Rep. Bob Latta (R., Ohio) said TikTok had been insulated from legal claims arising from the death of a 10-year-old girl who had participated in a breath-holding challenge that was popular on TikTok. Mr. Latta questioned why TikTok should be protected by federal law shielding websites when it amplifies \"dangerous and life-threatening content to children.\"\n",
      "Mr. Chew said that the platform has taken a number of proactive steps to better protect childrenâ€”including measures that go beyond those employed by other platforms. Accounts registered to teens under 16 are set to private by default, and they also can't send direct messages. Their content is ineligible for recommendation in the app's popular \"For You\" tab. He said dealing with harmful content was an industrywide challenge.\n",
      "Some lawmakers asked Mr. Chew if he agreed that China's government has persecuted the Uyghur ethnic group, which U.S. officials have characterized as a genocide. Mr. Chew answered by saying content about that issue was available on TikTok.\n",
      "After the testimony ended, TikTok spokeswoman Brooke Oberwetter said that political grandstanding had dominated the hearing, ignoring the solutions TikTok was working on to protect user data and keep content harmful to young people off the site.\n",
      "The hearing shed little light on how Congress might address the numerous problems with TikTok that lawmakers highlighted.\n",
      "Several bills are under consideration in Congress that would ban TikTok outright, typically by prohibiting U.S. companies from doing business with it. Some would also allow the government to ban or restrict other apps with ties to hostile foreign governments. Several lawmakers also urged renewed consideration of comprehensive privacy legislation.\n",
      "An actual ban on TikTok faces practical and legal hurdles, and two federal judges struck down former President Donald Trump's earlier attempts to do so. Any crackdown carries political risks, particularly for Democrats who tend to get more support from the younger people who are TikTok's dominant audience.\n",
      "Democrats appeared less inclined than Republicans to support an outright ban on the app, at least for now. Three Democrats appeared Wednesday with a group of TikTok stars to protest calls to ban the app. But a number of lawmakers from both parties expressed interest in a sale of TikTok's Chinese ownership.\n",
      "Rep. Lori Trahan (D., Mass.) said near the end of Thursday's hearing that Mr. Chew had fallen short of gaining lawmakers' trust. \"To me, it hasn't happened so far,\" she said.\n",
      "Rep. Randy Weber (R., Tex.) took a similar-sounding tone. \"If this committee has its way,\" he said, \"TikTok's time is up.\"\n",

      "Full text: Virginia-based power company AES Corp. says it is ready to push the button on a solar-panel order of more than $1 billion if a manufacturer will commit to building a factory in the U.S.\n",
      "If that factory gets built, AES can buy its panels and apply for federal subsidies recently made available to clean-energy developers that use equipment made in the U.S.\n",
      "There is one problem: The government hasn't decided what \"made in the U.S.\" means, and how strictly to define it.\n",
      "\"You can't sign on the dotted line until this is clarified,\" said AndrÃ©s Gluski, AES's chief executive. The company and two other developers have said they would collectively buy as much as $6 billion in panels from a manufacturer that sets up in the U.S.\n",
      "Just what qualifies as made in America is one of the biggest questions still hanging over the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed in August that offers hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits and other incentives for clean-energy projects . The issue is more complicated than it might seem, given that almost all clean-energy projects require at least some parts that are manufactured overseas.\n",
      "The law is supposed to spur not only the deployment of clean energy but also the creation of domestic jobs and industries to underpin that rollout. So lawmakers sprinkled support for U.S.-made products throughout the legislationâ€”from rebates for buying electric vehicles that contain significant domestic content to bonus tax credits for solar or wind developers that use enough U.S.-manufactured equipment.\n",
      "\"If we're going to use federal tax dollars, we're going to direct that investment into the United States and create American jobs,\" said John Podesta, senior adviser to President Biden for clean-energy innovation and implementation, at a Houston energy conference in early March. \"We've for too long let our supply chains drift overseas, particularly to China.\"\n",
      "As much as half of potentially $500 billion-plus in investment generated by the Inflation Reduction Act's incentives include some sort of domestic-content requirements or bonus, according to an analysis by research institute Rhodium Group.\n",
      "The money at stake has made defining what it would take to meet those requirements one of the most hotly contested aspects of the law, spurring complaints from governments as well as tussles among companies ranging from U.S. steelmaker Nucor Corp. to power company NextEra Energy Inc.â€”all of which are angling for as much of the green subsidies as possible.\n",
      "The details are being completed by the Treasury Department and are expected to come out over the next few months. The rules on one important incentiveâ€” a $7,500 tax rebate for electric-vehicle purchases , if the cars and their batteries meet domestic content and sourcing requirementsâ€”are expected by the end of this month.\n",
      "Meanwhile, many would-be investors are hanging back. In solar, wind and storage projects alone, about $20 billion in investment could be on hold while the government sorts out a variety of tax-credit details, with much of the attention on domestic-content rules, say clean-energy analysts.\n",
      "A big challenge is that much of the manufacturing the law is trying to spur barely exists in the U.S. today, from the silicon ingots and special glass needed for solar panels to the large steel plates for offshore wind arrays. The bulk of those products and components are instead imported from overseas, particularly China , which offers cheaper prices and controls the supply chain for goods such as solar panels and batteries.\n",
      "Defining \"made in America\" in a way that excludes most of those imports could mean nobody would meet domestic-content requirements or get the incentives tied to them, some green-energy developers say.\n",
      "Take solar projects, which under the legislation could in some cases receive 10% more in bonus tax credits if enough of the equipment by value is made domestically. That incentive has sparked a furious debate over solar panels, which alone can comprise 40% of the total equipment cost of a solar plant and are crucial to getting the bonus.\n",
      "Companies such as NextEra, the U.S.'s biggest developer of solar projects, are urging that panels assembled in the U.S. be considered American-made, even if the ingredients come from overseas. Such a definition would let more developers get bonus credits and encourage the construction of more solar farms, they reason.\n",
      "Developers need those bonus credits to offset higher panel costs that would come with moving more of the solar supply chain to the U.S., says AES clean-energy head Leonardo Moreno.\n",
      "Companies such as South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group's Qcells unit, which is planning a U.S. factory for panel components such as solar cells, disagree. A solar panel shouldn't be defined as U.S.-made if its most important pieces, especially the cells that convert sunlight to electricity, are made overseas, Hanwha said, in public comments submitted to the Treasury Department.\n",
      "Those components tend to be particularly costly and challenging to make, so the U.S. won't be able to build a domestic solar supply chain unless renewable-power developers are nudged to buy panels that use them, said Michael Carr, a partner at government-affairs consulting firm Boundary Stone Partners, which is lobbying for some manufacturers.\n",
      "Another contentious point is how to treat equipment made of iron and steel, such as the tower that holds up the engine and blades of a wind turbine. The legislation says the iron and steel should be made in America for a renewable-energy project to qualify for domestic-content bonuses, but is vague on exactly what that means.\n",
      "BCI Steel makes tubes for solar-panel trackers in Leetsdale, Pa. U.S. steelmakers say equipment that uses imported steel shouldn't count as being made in America. PHOTO: Ross Mantle for The Wall Street Journal\n",
      "Many renewable-energy developers are pushing for a domestic-content definition that would let them import many of those steel components.\n",
      "Such a definition would \"effectively nullify any benefit at all in the IRA,\" said Robert DeFrancesco, a lawyer at Wiley Rein LLP who is counsel for the Wind Tower Trade Coalition, a handful of big U.S. manufacturers.\n",
      "U.S. steelmakers have also weighed in, especially because the clean-energy industry's demand for steel is expected to triple by 2030, according to some estimates.\n",
      "Developers \"shouldn't get the credit that was intended to benefit American workers if they are bringing [steel] from overseas,\" said Al Behr, Nucor's executive vice president for plate and structural steel.\n",

Many of the funds, which had notched big gains as rates marched steadily upward in 2022, are now flat to down for the year following a steep recent drop in Treasury yields.

Bridgewater Associates's flagship Pure Alpha fund had lost a little more than 3% in March through Friday in its higher-volatility share class, while Switzerland-based EDL Capital, started by former Moore Capital Management money manager Edouard de Langlade, lost 5%, said people familiar with the firms.\n",
      "Overall, macro hedge funds lost an average 3.5% in the period, according to data from research firm HFR.\n",
      "Macro investors since late 2021 had widely been betting that stubbornly high inflation and a tight job market would cause the Federal Reserve to raise rates faster and for longer than previously expected. Instead, recent banking turmoil put a dent in rate expectations, with the yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note notching its largest weekly decline since 1987 last week. (Yields fall as bond prices rise.)\n",
      "Bonds also surged overseas. Traders say losses funds were taking on their bets against Treasurys spread to Japanese government bonds as managers unwound similar bets in efforts to curb losses.\n",
      "Many of the funds use leverage, or borrowed money, to amplify their bets, which can boost gains if the wagers pay off but prove costly if they sour. \"The magnitude of the losses really boils down to the fact that this was a levered trade that abruptly unwound,\" said Greg Dowling, chief investment officer of investment-consulting firm Fund Evaluation Group.\n",
      "In the span of some 48 hours in early March, Silicon Valley Bank's collapse changed investors' expectations about the path of interest rates in the U.S., Mr. Dowling said. Where investors previously expected that the Federal Reserve would continue to raise rates, they suddenly were confronted with the possibility that the central bank would ease up, fearing a banking crisis could tip the U.S. economy into recession . Such regime shifts are usually accompanied by months of changing data and messaging from the Federal Reserve.\n",
      "The Fed on Wednesday approved a quarter-percentage-point rate increase but signaled it might be done hiking sooner than previously expected, causing Treasury yields to slip further.\n",
      "London-based Maniyar, a macro hedge fund partly owned by Paul Tudor Jones, lost 22% for the month through Friday, according to people familiar with the firm. Haidar's Jupiter fund, which gained 193% in 2022, lost 32% for the period, said a person familiar with the firm. Bloomberg News earlier reported Haidar's loss.\n",
      "Among trend followers, which also profited by betting on higher rates last year, the Tactical Trend fund of the $18 billion Graham Capital Management lost about 10% for the month through Friday, said people familiar with the firm. Stockholm-based Lynx Asset Management's diversified trend-following strategy, the Lynx Program, also lost roughly 10% for the period.\n",
      "Rob Christian, investment chief at K2 Advisors, a Franklin Templeton unit that invests more than $10 billion of client money in hedge funds, said some giveback of outsize gains was to be expected for trend followers, officially known as commodity trading advisers, or CTAs. \"I always tell people you have to have an iron stomach to invest in CTAs,\" he said.\n",
      "A rare fund that profited is $1 billion Key Square Capital Management, based in Greenwich, Conn. In a March 13 investor letter, founder Scott Bessent, a former investment chief for George Soros, wrote that Key Square the prior week had increased its funds' exposures to gold and safe-haven currencies, shorted bank stocks and pulled back on energy exposure. Mr. Bessent since late last year had warned his clients that banks could face losses in their fixed-income and structured-products portfolios.\n",
      "SVB's failed attempt to sell shares before it collapsed the week of March 6 was a signal to Mr. Bessent that Fed rate increases were causing stress in the financial sector, he wrote. It was one of several \"signposts\" that prompted him to further position Key Square's portfolio for deepening turmoil.\n",
      "A person familiar with the firm said Key Square's main hedge fund was up 2.5% for the month through Friday. Another fund employing more leverage had gained 5%.\n",

      "Full text: CAIROâ€”After years of underinvestment in North Africa's energy infrastructure, global oil-and-gas giants from Halliburton Co. and Chevron Corp. to Eni SpA are ramping up their presence in the region as demand from Europe grows .\n",
      "Executives in the industry are betting it is worth drilling again in some of the hardest places to do business in the world as Europe increasingly turns to other sources for its energy needs after shunning its main supplier, Russia, over the invasion of Ukraine . In recent months, a string of European officials have visited the region to help advance talks over potential supply deals.\n",
      "Halliburton and Honeywell International Inc. are hammering out $1.4 billion worth of deals to develop an oil field and refinery with National Oil Corporation in Libya, which has the largest known oil reserves in Africa, according to the chairman of state-owned firm, Farhat Bengdara. Italy's Eni is planning investments aimed at replacing nearly half of the gas it was importing from Russia with gas from Algeria.\n",
      "Chevron is also looking to seal an energy exploration deal in Algeria, The Wall Street Journal reported last month . In January, the U.S. oil major announced a sizable natural-gas discovery in Egypt.\n",
      "\"North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,\" said Geoff Porter, president of U.S.-based North Africa Risk Consulting Inc. But with Europe needing to replace Russian energy , \"this is their moment,\" he said.\n",
      "Western oil executives say they see a more stable political climate in North Africa, especially in countries such as Libya where fighting between local militias has been subdued in the past two years following nearly a decade of civil war. Many American firms had pulled back from the region, viewing it as politically too risky, to focus on shale production at home. The region's proximity to Europe and massive reserves, with Algeria holding the third-largest recoverable shale resources in the world, also make doing business there worth the risk, they say.\n",
      "At the same time, state-owned firms in the North African region have been eager to strike deals, as they see an opportunity to fill a gap left by Russia and take advantage of higher global commodity prices. Some countries, such as Egypt, are eager to bring in additional revenue from selling energy, as their economies struggle with higher import costs including for food . The Ukraine war has disrupted shipments and pushed up global commodity prices.\n",
      "\"I think we can be a good replacement for Russian gas to Europe,\" NOC's Mr. Bengdara said.\n",
      "The Libyan state-owned company is expected to soon sign a $1 billion agreement with Halliburton that will allow the U.S. firm to rebuild the al-Dhara oil field, according to Mr. Bengdara. The oil field in central Libya was destroyed by Islamic State militants in 2015 and is now run by ConocoPhillips and TotalEnergies SE, Mr. Bengdara said. It would be one of the biggest deals for the U.S. oil-services giant clinched in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years.\n",
      "Halliburton and Total didn't respond to requests for comment. ConocoPhillips declined to comment.\n",
      "Libya's NOC and Honeywell are set to unveil a contract related to the construction of a refinery in southern Libya, Mr. Bengdara and a spokesman for the American firm said. The initial deal, expected to be announced this weekend, is for the design of the plant, the spokesman said, which would be followed by a $400 million pact to build the entire plant.\n",
      "Libya relies heavily on its oil resources for income, although it has struggled for years to turn its own crude into motor fuel, making it largely dependent on costly gasoline imports.\n",
      "As of last year, the North African nation was divided politically again, with a United Nations-appointed prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, remaining in control of the capital Tripoli and a rival prime minister taking charge of the country's east. The country is again pushing to hold presidential and legislative elections this year, after plans fell through in 2021.\n",
      "Still, there have been no serious clashes since last summer and its eastern government in recent months has unlocked some of the budget needed by the state oil company to clinch deals with international companies.\n",
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a senate committee on Wednesday that the U.S. was actively working to reopen an embassy in Libya, in part so it could better support the prospect of Libyan elections. The U.S. shut its embassy in Tripoli in 2014 following violent clashes between militias.\n",
      "The U.S. also pressured a top Libyan commander in mid-January to expel Russia's paramiliatry Wagner Group , the Journal reported last month, amid fears the unit may tap into the country's oil riches. Khalifa Haftar, commander of a faction that controls eastern Libya , is aligned with the government in Tripoli .\n",
      "\"There is recognition in the U.S. that Libya is a workable environment,\" said Mr. Porter, who advises U.S. oil companies in the region. He added that firms now see it as \"an environment in which you can operate reasonably safely, where you can more predictably invest in ways that you could not have a few years ago.\"\n",
      "NOC exports most of its gas to Europe through a pipeline from Libya to Italy. Over the next three to five years, it aims to increase oil production to 2 million barrels a day, from around 1.2 million currently, and to produce 4 billion standard cubic feet of gas a day, up from roughly 2.6 billion.\n",
      "In January, NOC and Eni, which produces the majority of the country's gas, signed an $8 billion deal for the Italian energy giant to develop two gas fields to pump 850 million cubic feet a day for 25 years. Under the agreement, production of gas will start in 2025, ramping up to full capacity of 850 million cubic feet a day by 2026.\n",
      "In Algeria, Eni is aiming to export an additional 3 billion cubic meters of gas annually, starting this year, to help make up for gas that used to flow from Russia. Algeria will become the firm's top region for investment in the next four years.\n",
      "\"Algeria is a reliable partner of absolute strategic importance,\" said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during a visit to Algiers in January.\n",
      "From Egypt, Eni aims to export three billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Italy starting this year, after regas capacity was built up on the receiving end. That compares with roughly 1 billion cubic meters being exported last year.\n",
      "Egypt's ability to export gas is limited given the growing electricity demand of its more than 100 million population. It doesn't have any pipelines to Europe. Still, the country has ambitions to become a hub for energy distribution in the Mediterranean, importing more gas from Israel and exporting liquefied gas on ships to Italy.\n",

      "Full text: GARDEN CITY, Kan. -- Southwest Kansas officials have long pushed a moonshot aqueduct project to send Missouri River water across the state to their region, where a $12.5 billion agricultural economy relies on a dwindling underground aquifer.\n",
      "While the effort has been dismissed as legally impossible and expensive, the persistence of the idea demonstrates how drought and a steadily shrinking water supply have created broad consensus that water policies need to be overhauled. In Kansas, where federal data shows that nearly every county was experiencing some level of drought at the end of 2022, water is among the most urgent issues facing the state legislature this year.\n",
      "\"Water has a certain value,\" said Clay Scott, a Ulysses, Kan., farmer and one of the aqueduct's proponents. \"Every year it just continues to climb.\"\n",
      "Projects that move water have been used to fuel development or to irrigate crops in Western states such as Arizona and California. The Kansas aqueduct would be farther east -- reflecting spreading concern about the scarcity of water amid a changing climate and growing population centers.\n",
      "Similar projects are being discussed elsewhere. A groundwater-conservation district in Texas is interested in studying water-transportation projects, including a version of the Kansas aqueduct route extended to Texas, said district manager Steve Walthour.\n",
      "Some arid states have looked east to boost limited water supplies. The Arizona state legislature in 2021 asked Congress to study a plan to transport Mississippi River floodwaters to the Colorado River, upon which seven states including Arizona rely.\n",
      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers first assessed the feasibility for a Kansas aqueduct in 1982, as part of a federal study looking at ways to supplement the Ogallala Aquifer, the region's critical source of groundwater. A 2015 update of the study estimated it would cost between $5 billion and $20 billion to build the concrete-lined canal system and up to $522 million in annual energy costs to pump the water uphill to its terminal reservoir in western Kansas.\n",
      "Proponents of the Kansas aqueduct say it is needed to sustain the economy of the state's southwest and could sell water to other Western areas that have already taken extreme measures to conserve water or find new water sources.\n",
      "Without a means to augment the region's underground reserves, \"we will continue to dry up the infrastructure for feed yards and dairies and grain elevators and cotton gins,\" said Mr. Scott, who is a member ofthe board for the Southwest Kansas Groundwater Management District.\n",
      "Opponents say the idea is too expensive, and would need to fend off a likely onslaught of lawsuits from states along the Missouri River or landowners whose property would be used to build a canal system.\n",
      "\"The legal, economic, physical and regulatory hurdles this thing faces are virtually infinite,\" said Burke Griggs, a law professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., who is an expert in water law and who previously represented Kansas in federal and interstate water issues. \"There's no way this will ever be built.\"\n",
      "Even those who have taken no position on an aqueduct say much of the aquifer could run dry before the project is complete.\n",
      "\"By the time you got done with studying, planning, litigating, constructing,\" said Connie Owen, who heads the Kansas Water Office, an agency that writes the state's water plan, \"it is too late.\"\n",
      "The Ogallala Aquifer lies under parts of eight central U.S. states, running from South Dakota to Texas. It adds $3.8 billion to the value of the land in western Kansas, one 2022 study found.\n",
      "Blake Brownie Wilson, with the Kansas Geological Survey, says 80% to 90% of the aquifer's water in Kansas goes to irrigation. In some parts of southwest Kansas, the aquifer has dropped more than 100 feet since it began being mined. About 30% of it had been pumped as of 2013. An additional 39% was expected to be gone by 2063 given current rates of use.\n",
      "In December, aboard in the Kansas Water Office recommended that the state stop its policy of slowly draining the aquifer. \"Planned depletion was the operative approach,\" Ms. Owen said. \"It still is.\"\n",
      "Recent drought has increased pressure on the aquifer's use. Groundwater levels fell nearly 3 feet in southwest Kansas, which is experiencing the most intense and widespread drought nationwide. Less than an inch of rainfall typically seeps into the aquifer to recharge it each year.\n",
      "The groundwater district that manages water use in southwest Kansas thinks conserving water is appropriate but not enough. Officials in the district have been the primary proponents of the aqueduct plan in Kansas.\n",
      "The project remains a long shot. Kansas lawmakers this year are focused on bills aimed at promoting conservation and dedicating tax revenue to water projects.\n",
      "Proponents say it is the right time to look into an aqueduct because of how long it would take to be built.\n",
      "\"We can't afford to wait any longer,\" said Mr. Scott.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTON -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 Republican presidential candidate, sought to qualify his controversial remark that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a \"territorial dispute.\"\n",
      "\"Well, I think it's been mischaracterized,\" he told broadcaster Piers Morgan for an interview to be shown Thursday on the streaming service Fox Nation. Mr. Morgan included the comments in a column Wednesday for The New York Post.\n",
      "\"Obviously, Russia invaded. That was wrong,\" Mr. DeSantis said, according to the column. \"They invaded Crimea and took that in 2014. That was wrong.\"\n",
      "He added, \"What I'm referring to is where the fighting is going on now which is that eastern border region Donbas, and then Crimea, and you have a situation where Russia has had that. I don't think legitimately but they had . . . . so it wasn't that I thought Russia had a right to that.\"\n",
      "Mr. DeSantis said last week that the U.S. shouldn't necessarily help defend Ukraine against Russia's invasion and should instead focus resources on issues closer to home.\n",
      "It aligned him with the position of former President Donald Trump and some conservatives who have increasingly questioned thetens of billions the U.S. has provided in security assistance to Ukraine.\n",
      "\"While the U.S. has many vital national interests -- securing our borders, addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy security and independence, and checking the economic, cultural, and military power of the Chinese Communist Party -- becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them,\" Mr. DeSantis had said in a statement broadcast on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" on Fox News.\n",

      "Full text: Kassie Meiler endured six hours in an online waiting room to score tickets to one of Taylor Swift's coming concerts. Now, she is gearing up -- literally -- for the stamina test of the pop star's 44-song, three-hour show.\n",
      "Instead of heels, the 27-year-old plans to wear platform Keds, the sneaker brand Ms. Swift once endorsed. Rather than a sparkly fringe jacket similar to what Ms. Swift sports onstage, Ms. Meiler is seeking a cooler option for the April show in Tampa, Fla., that she will attend, perhaps in vest form.\n",
      "She will swap her usual cocktail or white wine for an electrolyte drink, she said. Mentally, Ms. Meiler is pulling confidence from the 24-hour dance marathons she completed in college: \"If I can do that, I can do a Taylor Swift tour.\"\n",
      "Ms. Swift stunned fans opening night on her first tour in five years by performing a 190-minute set that followed two opening acts. Word spread quickly online of the stadium show's length, prompting nervous strategy brainstorms among fans now rethinking everything from their elaborate outfits to hydration methods.\n",
      "The Eras Tour, which is scheduled to run 52 stadium dates, is forecast to become the highest-grossing tour of all time, according to concert-data tracker Pollstar. The show is a combination of Ms. Swift's pandemic pursuits and her efforts to take ownership of her life's work by rerecording her early music. After her festival-style shows for her 2019 \"Lover\" album were canceled because of Covid-19, she released two surprise albums penned in pandemic isolation.\n",
      "The Eras Tour set list spans her entire catalog, including songs from \"Folklore,\" which won the Grammy for Album of the Year and \"Evermore,\" which earned a Grammy nomination -- as well as hits that she rerecorded from \"Fearless\" and \"Red.\" Late last year, she released \"Midnights,\" which shattered sales records.\n",
      "Packing so much material into one show amounts to an endurance test for Ms. Swift, too. Her 44-song set dwarfs that of other rock stars known for long shows, according to data from Setlist.fm. Prince's 2004 shows and Beyonce's 2018 Coachella sets each averaged 32 songs. Bruce Springsteen averaged 29 songs in 1985 and 27 in 2012. Bob Dylan's 1978 world tour averaged 28 songs, according to Setlist.fm.\n",
      "Stadium shows are a badge of honor for music's biggest stars. Only an elite few can fill them, and on this tour Ms. Swift has sold out multiple nights in each city she visits. Her Homeric effort, which includes the 10-minute version of fan-favorite song \"All Too Well,\" is baffling fans and industry insiders.\n",
      "\"Sure, Springsteen and Prince played these legendary long shows, but they were not singing the entire time. They had bands, and a whole lot of instrumental work that extended out the show,\" said Nathan Hubbard, former Ticketmaster chief executive and co-host of the Ringer's \"Every Single Album: Taylor Swift\" podcast series.\n",
      "\"Taylor is singing as the center lead for the entirety of the show, and she's doing it in heels,\" he said.\n",
      "A representative for Ms. Swift didn't respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "In addition to singing and dancing, Ms. Swift flies, runs, climbs and, yes, even dives around the stadium -- in a series of custom Christian Louboutins.\n",
      "\"Three-hour shows. @taylorswift is definitely a distance swimmer,\" Olympic gold-medalist swimmer Katie Ledecky tweeted Tuesday.\n",
      "Mr. Hubbard estimated that if Ms. Swift's movements were tracked as soccer players were during the World Cup, she travels a mile during the show, maybe two.\n",
      "Former NFL defensive end J.J. Watt lauded Ms. Swift's rigor in a 2 1/2-minute video posted to Twitter after seeing her Saturday show in Glendale, Ariz. \"She did not stop the whole time -- there was no halftime, there was no TV timeouts,\" he said. \"She crushed it, and she didn't even look tired. I was tired, and I was just sitting there.\"\n",
      "Daniela Morgan, 40, is doubling up on Las Vegas shows this weekend. On Friday night, she is attending solo with a $760 standing-room-only floor ticket. For Saturday night, She initially planned to take a friend, but her 10-year-old son, Eli, begged to go instead.\n",
      "Eli has heard reminders from his dad about the responsibility that comes with taking a $350 ticket to see his mom's favorite artist, Ms. Morgan said. \"Is my kid going to be able to hang three hours?\" she said.\n",
      "Claire Ginther, a 26-year-old from Huntington Beach, Calif., has a shoe dilemma. To see Ms. Swift in Las Vegas this weekend, she had planned an outfit based on the pastel, 1960s aesthetic of Ms. Swift's \"Lover\" album. Her new go-go boots arrived this week, but now she is debating switching to sneakers for comfort. With her 5'1\" height and $750 floor tickets, she risks not being able to see much, she said.\n",
      "For advice, she is combing through TikTok, where concertgoers are trading survival tips. \"You'd think people are talking about running the L.A. Marathon,\" she said. \"They're talking about going to see Taylor Swift.\"\n",
      "Meanwhile, Ms. Ginther wonders about Ms. Swift's stamina lasting until the tour's closing shows in Los Angeles in August, for which Ms. Ginther said she paid $100 for a nosebleed seat. \"Is she just going to be crawling to the finish line when she gets to L.A.?\"\n",
      "For an April show in Texas, Catherine Frisina, 33, plans to hydrate sparingly with Liquid I.V., a powder that is mixed with water and promises an energy boost. \"If Taylor doesn't need a bathroom break neither do I,\" she said.\n",
      "Andrea Alfano, who fueled up with pizza for back-to-back concerts on the tour's opening weekend, said making it through the actual show isn't the hardest part.\n",
      "\"The adrenaline of being there carries you through the show itself,\" the 26-year-old daycare teacher said. It was after the show in Glendale -- facing an hourslong wait for an Uber -- when she realized she was tired and her cowboy-boot-clad feet hurt. \"The hardest part is getting out of the stadium.\"\n",
      "At three hours, Rob Dobyns said his favorite part about Ms. Swift's coming show in Kansas City is that his wife and three teen daughters are going and he isn't. The 45-year-old prefers '90s Seattle grunge bands but calls himself a Taylor Swift fan by proxy. \"I couldn't tell you the name of any songs but as they're constantly screamed throughout the house, I could probably sing along to several.\"\n",
      "His wife, whom he calls \"the hype man for our family,\" will make the three-hour trek from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Kansas City, Mo., where the four of them will stay in a hote. Back home, Mr. Dobyns, a retired cop turned software engineer, has plans for a marathon of his own: scary movies, beer and steaks for himself and the dog.\n",

      "Full text: TORONTO -- Multinational companies are pumping billions of dollars into Canada's electric-vehicle manufacturing sector, lured by government incentives, access to raw materials and cheap renewable energy.\n",
      "In the latest sign of interest in the country, German auto maker Volkswagen Group last week said it had chosen a site in the province of Ontario to build its first battery-cell plant outside Europe. A company spokesman declined to provide specifics about the investment, but Canada's industry minister said the investment, in the town of St. Thomas, 120 miles northeast of Detroit, could rank as the largest ever made in Canada's auto sector.\n",
      "\"This is a big moment for Canada,\" said Francois-Philippe Champagne, Canada's minister of innovation, science and industry, about the many investments.\n",
      "Volkswagen cited Canada's natural resources as one of the reasons for choosing Ontario.\n",
      "\"Canada offers ideal conditions, including the local supply of raw materials and wide access to clean electricity,\" the company said.\n",
      "Volkswagen's planned factory follows recent electric-vehicle and battery-making project investments by General Motors Co., Stellantis NV, French tire maker Michelin NV, Brazilian miner Vale, its U.K.-based rival Rio Tinto PLC, and German chemicals company BASF SE, among others.\n",
      "Canada is benefiting from a push by the U.S. and its allies to reduce their dependence on China for the critical minerals used in electric-vehicle batteries and military equipment. Companies announced more than $11 billion in investments in electric-vehicle-related projects in Canada last year, according to a tally of company announcements. The U.S., which has an economy that is 12 times as large as Canada's, recorded $38.9 billion of similar investments in 2022, according to the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan-based nonprofit.\n",
      "In one example, Stellantis and South Korea's LG Energy Solution are building a $4.1 billion battery plant in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river from Detroit. The joint venture, named NextStar Energy Inc., broke ground on the factory late last year and could employ 2,500 workers when it becomes operational in 2024, Stellantis said.\n",
      "Canada has had to pay up to win the investments, scrambling to keep up with the U.S., which has unveiled a raft of subsidies and tax breaks meant to draw capital investment in the EV industry.\n",
      "In the case of the NextStar project, Canada's federal government and the province of Ontario gave more than one billion Canadian dollars, equivalent to $732 million, to the joint venture, said people with knowledge of the transaction. The Canadian government has also contributed money to investments by Rio Tinto, Honda Canada Inc., GM and others.\n",
      "The new investments, many of which are still in the early stages, come amid a decadeslong decline in the Canadian auto industry. Canada is among the most expensive countries in the world to build cars and the highest-cost market for car assembly in the North American free-trade zone. To save money, auto makers in recent decades moved thousands of manufacturing jobs and motor-vehicle assembly capacity to Mexico.\n",
      "At its peak in 1999, Canadian auto production surpassed three million vehicles and employed more than 175,000 people, according to the Trillium Network for Advanced Manufacturing, a nonprofit. Last year, the local industry produced 1.2 million vehicles and employed 110,000 people.\n",
      "It is unclear whether the new investments will reverse the declining trend, said Greig Mordue, an associate processor at the University of McMaster's W. Booth School of Engineering Practice and Technology. Making batteries and electric vehicles needs fewer people than assembling internal-combustion-engine cars, he said, and the amount of money invested using taxpayer funds could limit the economic benefit.\n",
      "\"Until we know how much we paid for this, I'll reserve my judgment on how good a deal this is,\" said Mr. Mordue, in reference to the Volkswagen deal.\n",
      "Mr. Champagne declined to disclose the value of subsidies and incentives that the government offered Volkswagen. He said the long-term benefits to the Canadian economy from the new projects justify the government's investments.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTON -- TikTok launched a battalion of influencers in the nation's capital Wednesday to send a message to Congress: Banning the app would be met with widespread popular opposition.\n",
      "\"TikTok is not a children's dancing app,\" said Aidan Kohn-Murphy, a college freshman with close to 300,000 TikTok followers and founder of the advocacy group Gen-Z for Change. \"It is one of the most powerful tools that young people have to engage each other and to get civically involved.\"\n",
      "Mr. Kohn-Murphy was one of more than 20 TikTok personalities with wide followings who traveled to the capital this week at the company's invitation to lobby lawmakers and others in advance of TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew's appearance before a House committee on Thursday.\n",
      "The influencers' blitz is part of TikTok's response to persistent concerns among U.S. officials that the app, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., could be used by the Chinese government to spy on Americans or promote divisive or manipulative content.\n",
      "The Biden administration recently demanded that TikTok's Chinese owners sell their stakes in the company or face a possible U.S. ban of the app, and members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee are expected to question Mr. Chew about the security concerns and other issues.\n",
      "TikTok maintains that it isn't beholden to any government and is a vital platform for 150 million American users -- a theme the influencers worked to underscore in a meeting with journalists near the Capitol on Wednesday.\n",
      "\"It would be difficult to be able to support a candidate that would take away something that is so integral to the direction we're going as a society,\" said Baedri Nichole, a bakery owner from Columbus, Ohio, whose \"hot cocoa bomb\" confection is a hit on TikTok.\n",
      "Kenny Jary, an 81-year-old retiree known on TikTok as Patriotic Kenny, said he uses the app to raise money to buy mobility scooters for fellow veterans.\n",
      "Others said the app provided a platform to launch small businesses or discuss topics such as eldercare and mental health.\n",
      "TikTok covered the group's travel and accommodation expenses. The company bused the influencers on Wednesday to the Capitol grounds, where they gathered on a scenic rooftop to shoot their own videos and stand for journalists' interviews.\n",
      "After threats of banning the app started during the Trump administration, the company has spent recent years building a U.S.-based security apparatus to wall off U.S. user data and give officials the ability to inspect the computer code that recommends a steady feed of videos to users.\n",
      "TikTok stars were a crucial factor in the company's successful effort to fight off a proposed ban during the Trump years. Whether they will have the same influence this time around remains to be seen.\n",
      "\"I'm aware of the popularity of the platform. I'm not oblivious,\" said Rep. Yvette Clarke (D., N.Y.), a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee who hasn't yet taken a position on a potential ban. \"However, it's important to weigh our equities here. National security has to be addressed.\"\n",
      "Ahead of Mr. Chew's appearance, TikTok has ramped up lobbying efforts with the help of Oracle Corp., its U.S. data-security partner. Advertisements at the capital's Metro subway stops tout the company's commitment to user safety.\n",

      "Full text: The most memorable event of the 2023 baseball season took place on Tuesday night, over a week before the MLB regular season is set to begin. With a full count and two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning of a one-run game, Los Angeles Angels superstar Shohei Ohtani stood on the mound in Miami and faced his Angels teammate, Mike Trout.\n",
      "It was the U.S. against Japan in the title game of the World Baseball Classic. But it was also the marquee moment baseball fans have been hoping to see since Ohtani made his MLB debut in 2018: The two greatest baseball players in the world, performing in a high-leverage moment in a championship game. The twist was that they were opponents, not teammates.\n",
      "\"The baseball world won tonight,\" said Team USA manager Mark DeRosa after Japan's 3-2 victory in the final.\n",
      "Ohtani didn't spare Trout in his effort to close out the victory for Japan. He set up the at-bat with a sweeping slider, then fired off four consecutive fastballs to Trout, all around 100 miles per hour or faster. Ohtani struck Trout out swinging on another sweeping slider, ending the game, the tournament, and setting up quite a scenario in the Angels clubhouse when the two report back to spring training this week.\n",
      "\"This was probably the funnest 10 days I've ever had,\" Trout said after the game. As a member of the Angels, he has only appeared briefly in the MLB playoffs once. Ohtani hasn't appeared in the playoffs at all.\n",
      "Ohtani won the battle against Trout, but the two typically stolid superstars spent the tournament showing big emotions as they each worked their way toward that final at-bat. Trout was the first to reach base against Japan, legging out a first-inning double and giving an emphatic salute as he found himself safe. Ohtani was the engine of Team Japan, delivering a pregame speech to his teammates in the clubhouse before the final game of the tournament.\n",
      "The two players have to this point spent their MLB careers mostly languishing in Anaheim, with the chance to compete for a championship maddeningly out of reach. In this matchup, Trout and Ohtani weren't just given the opportunities to experience baseball on a big stage. They were clear leaders for their respective teams. The chance to see the longtime teammates face off against one another represented the best that international baseball has to offer.\n",
      "\"This is the greatest game in the world,\" Angels manager Phil Nevin said after watching his star players from Arizona. \"No other sport can bring drama like baseball.\"\n",
      "Earlier in the tournament, it was expected that Ohtani would pitch in a quarterfinals game then return to spring training to make an exhibition start to line him up for opening day. When Japan reached the WBC final, the Angels authorized him to depart from his typical routine to be available to pitch against the U.S. Now, he closed out the tournament and won its MVP, and is still on track to take the ball on Angels opening day.\n",
      "This year's WBC turned out to be a massive success for MLB -- even accounting for major injuries to Mets closer Edwin Diaz (out for the season with a knee injury) and Astros second baseman Jose Altuve (broken thumb after being hit by a pitch).\n",
      "They were reminders of the risk of playing full-effort games in March. The tournament turned out to have high-energy, competitive games, and the final matchup of USA-Japan was undoubtedly a pairing of baseball powerhouses.\n",
      "The WBC will return in 2026, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred told reporters in Miami on Tuesday.\n",
      "\"The World Series is always gonna be the World Series,\" Manfred said. \"This is a different kind of competition. We do it to grow the game and internationalize the game.\"\n",
      "Ohtani was named the tournament's MVP after hitting .435, with a .606 on base percentage and a .739 slugging percentage in seven games for Japan. He also had a 1.86 ERA in three appearances -- two starts and his appearance as the closer in the final. The tournament furthered his status as an international spectacle, and he wept on the field as he lined up with the rest of Team Japan to be honored during the trophy ceremony.\n",
      "Ohtani and Trout, along with Team Mexico pitcher Patrick Sandoval, will return to the Angels clubhouse with plenty of material for trash talking and an early-season taste of championship excitement. Whether the experience will benefit the Angels remains to be seen. They still face tough competition this season, particularly against the defending champion Astros in the American League West.\n",
      "MLB's regular season begins a week from Thursday, and players who faced one another in the WBC will be reunited as teammates for the long season marathon. For years, baseball wanted to see Ohtani and Trout playing on a big stage. They got there as opponents, but the next step for their careers will be getting there as teammates.\n",

      "Full text: WASHINGTON -- TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Zi Chew has navigated both Western and Chinese business over the course of his fast rise to the corner office.\n",
      "That cultural straddle has helped land him the top job at one of the world's biggest tech companies. His background may now help him connect with a skeptical American Congress. Many members have threatened to ban TikTok, saying its Chinese ownership poses a national-security threat.\n",
      "On Thursday, the 40-year-old Singaporean Army reservist and former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker is slated to appear before a House panel to argue against a ban and reassure Americans their data are safe and Beijing won't be able to influence what viewers see on TikTok.\n",
      "Born and raised in Singapore, then educated in London and at Harvard Business School, Mr. Chew spent some of his early career cutting deals for a venture-capital firm in Asia. He then quickly moved to the C-suite as the chief financial officer of a Chinese smartphone giant at age 32.\n",
      "He runs TikTok from offices in Singapore but travels often, including frequently to the U.S. He met his wife, a Taiwanese-American who grew up in Bethesda, Md., at Harvard.\n",
      "Relatively unknown for the boss of one of the world's mostpopular apps, Mr. Chew will be asked to defend the company in front of some of its more skeptical critics on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n",
      "Aides to the Republicans who control the committee say there is essentially nothing Mr. Chew can saythat would change their mindsas they threaten a nationwideban.\n",
      "In an interview from the company's WeWork offices in Washington, he said he views Thursday's hearing as a chance to explain what TikTok is trying to do and to get feedback from Congress members -- not a last-gasp effort to save TikTok'sAmerican business.\n",
      "\"I look at it as an opportunity to do that, not a do-or-die\" moment, he said.\n",
      "The corporate stakes for Mr. Chew are as high as they get for a CEO facing such an appearance in Washington. Some Congress members from both major parties are pushing for a nationwide ban of the video app, citing national-security threats. The Biden administration isdemanding TikTok divestitself from its Chinese parent, ByteDance Ltd., or face such a ban.\n",
      "Critics say China could force TikTok to hand over American user data or influence what American viewers see on the app. TikTok has said it has never received such a request and would refuse to comply with one.\n",
      "Mr. Chew took over the top job afterKevin Mayer,a high-profile Walt Disney Co. alum, left his post after three months, while the Trump administration pursued an earlier effort to force a sale of TikTok to U.S. investors.\n",
      "He is a native English speaker who, like most Singaporeans, is of Chinese ancestry. His father worked in construction and his mother in bookkeeping.\n",
      "He said he was uprooted from a modest upbringing at age 12, when high marks on a national exam sent him to an elite high school.\n",
      "Mr. Chew was put on an officer track during his mandatory 2 1/2 years of military service. That added 10 years to his eligibility for reserve duty, which ends when he is 50.\n",
      "The hardest physical experience of his life, he said, was the military's five-day survival course in Brunei's jungles. He built a hut, cooked wild yams and trekked 55 miles. At one point during such courses, trainees are given a live quail that they can kill with their hands before skinning and cooking it. In the interview, Mr. Chew didn't want to discuss what he did with his bird.\n",
      "After the military, Mr. Chew attended University College London and remained in the British capital to work as a banker for Goldman Sachs.\n",
      "Following an internship at Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook and business school, Mr. Chew worked for venture-capital firm DST Global.\n",
      "His high-school-level Mandarin qualified him to be its China-focused partner.\n",
      "In 2012, he visited the Chinese equivalent of a Silicon Valley garage: an apartment in Beijing's university district. Thirty people, including a chef, crammed in to develop an app that suggested news articles to people based on factors such as how much time they spent on previous stories.\n",
      "The company was ByteDance, which would go on to create TikTok. Its founder, Zhang Yiming, won over Mr. Chew. He and his partners invested in the company.\n",
      "\"The idea is so simple but so powerful: that you should be looking at content not based on who you know, but really based on your own behavior,\" Mr. Chew said.\n",
      "Another investment Mr. Chew led was in Xiaomi Corp., a Chinese smartphone giant with global ambitions. Xiaomi brought him over first as chief financial officer and then had him run its business outside China.\n",

       "{'Mar 31, 2023': ['MY FIRST EXPERIENCE with city cycling wasn\\'t promising. The suburban rides of my childhood hadn\\'t prepared me for crumbling concrete, hulking cargo trucks and hostile drivers. By the time I moved to New York City six years ago, biking seemed absurd. At the start of the pandemic, however, traffic vanished from my neighborhood in Brooklyn and it seemed like everyone took to two wheels. The New York City Department of Transportation reported it tracked 33% more bike trips year-over-year between May and December of 2020. Recently, I realized I was tired of being too scared to join the new wave of cyclists. The data wasn\\'t encouraging. American streets are dangerous places, even in a two-ton box of steel. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said the U.S. had the highest per capita rate of deaths from road accidents among the 38 countries from its data set in 2021, the most recent year for which it has statistics. Explore buy side from WSJ And cyclists face considerable threats. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported that fatal injuries to cyclists went up by 9.2% between 2019 and 2020, and by another 5.2% by the end of the 2021. Sheryl Porter, a 52-year-old stay-at-home mom in Grand Prairie, Texas, told me drivers sometimes play \"Chicken\" with her. More chilling, Mark Lowe, 49, a physician assistant in Aurora, Colo., said he once had a driver ride beside him, roll down his window and aim a handgun in his face. And yet, both bike a lot. Veon McReynolds, 71, a retired university administrator, said the key to staying safe is treating cars like dogs. \"If you come up to a dog and feel like it\\'s going to bite you, you\\'ll approach that dog a lot differently.\" He said even drivers in Houston, full of six-lane highways, respect cyclists who look comfortable and regularly look behind them. Dressing the part can also help. Though some studies indicate that drivers give cyclists with helmets less room, most people I talked to always wear one. Most also ride with front- and taillights, both to be more visible and ensure they can spot hazards. After buying a helmet, I borrowed a bike and tried projecting confidence in a small loop in my neighborhood. I\\'m sure I resembled a giraffe calf, awkwardly shifting my weight to find balance. But for the most part, car drivers gave me a wide berth. It felt a lot less scary than I\\'d imagined. For advice more-specific to New York, I took a lesson with Bike New York, a not-for-profit that hosts free classes for cyclists of all ages and experience levels. Rich Conroy, director of education, taught me how to make sure my bike was in good shape before I rode, watched me practice a graceful stop (the trick is to press down on your brakes gradually, not too hard or too quickly), and showed me how to deploy my bike\\'s gears to crush hills. The most useful lesson, however, was the \"power start.\" When stopped at a light, put the foot of your dominant leg on the ground, and keep the other on the pedal, held parallel with the bottom tube. When the light turns green, push off the ground hard, then down on the pedal. You\\'ll zoom. Since my lesson, I\\'ve encountered some unexpected annoyances like construction and tricky intersections. More than once, I\\'ve had to raise my voice to get the attention of a driver who was seemingly scrolling through TikTok. But I\\'ve avoided tragedy. I zipped down to a coffee shop to meet a friend. I corralled a group into crossing the Manhattan Bridge, with the promise of dumplings in Chinatown. Even pedaling to Bike Plant, a shop by my house, to buy gloves felt like an adventure. Of course, New York\\'s bike infrastructure is relatively good. You can easily navigate from bike lane to bike lane. This wasn\\'t the case circa 2000. \"Biking in New York City used to look like a cross between a \\'70s disaster film and \\'Mad Max,\\'\" said Janette Sadik-Khan, currently a principal at Bloomberg Associates, a philanthropic consulting firm. Then the streets were filled with potholes, glass and loose gravel. In 2007, she became the NYC DOT commissioner, with a mandate to reshape the streets to be safer and more friendly to pedestrians, buses and cyclists. Ms. Sadik-Khan said she aimed to create connected networks of bike paths, so that you could go from path to path on your way anywhere, minimizing the amount of time you had to bike in the flow of car traffic. Since she left the department in 2013, the city has continued this work. New York now has over 1,500 miles of dedicated bike lanes. The proliferation has dramatically increased cycling traffic, but NYC DOT data collected between 2000 and 2018 indicates the infrastructure improvements have reduced the risk of severe injury and death to cyclists by 80% . Similar changes might be coming to streets near you in the wake of the pandemic biking boom. According to estimates from StreetLight Data, a mobility analytics research firm, at least 15 U.S. cities saw a staggering 50% year-over-year growth in bicycling between September 2019 and the same month in 2020, including centers like Omaha, Neb., Little Rock, Ark., and Birmingham, Ala. Streets in some cities have been closed to car traffic. All the while, splashy bike-lane projects are under way in places like Providence, R.I., and Bloomington, Ind. I\\'m ready to try them all. Especially now that it\\'s spring. BELLS AND WHISTLES A few accessories to help keep you safe, and ensure you don\\'t spend so much time fretting about losing your bike that you never leave home 1. Agreeable Alerter If you haven\\'t used a bell since your tricycle days, get one—they\\'re an easy way to signal your presence to pedestrians and drivers. The Spurcycle Bell ($59) is remarkably resonant, which means people will even hear it from inside their SUVs. 2. Hard Hat Many new helmets like the Giro Register ($70) are designed with an extra internal liner, which can minimize the amount of rotational forces your head experiences in a crash. Helmets with this feature will have a yellow sticker that says \"MIPS\" on the side. I\\'ve also been using an attached EVT Helmet Mirror ($40), which improves my spatial awareness, though it\\'s no substitute for looking back. 3. Theft Protection While you can certainly use a regular Bluetooth tracker like the Tile Sticker with your bike, the Knog Scout ($60) is designed to be mounted more stealthily. It\\'s fully waterproof and can produce an extremely loud sound if you deem your bike lost. 4. Pump it Up In the case of a flat tire, you\\'ll always want to keep a patch kit (like the TT02 from Rema Tip Top ($3.50)) and bike pump on hand. The Topeak Mini ($40) is bitty and light (only 6 ounces), but has a foldout foot pad that makes it easy to use. 5. Infinite Illumination Front and rear lighting help you both see and be seen. The Sinewave Beacon 2 ($350) is a front light that works in conjunction with a Dynamo hub, which, when installed to your wheel, captures some of the energy you use to pedal and converts it to electricity. This makes the Beacon a light you\\'ll never have to recharge. Bonus: it has a USB port for juicing up your phone. 6. Major Key It\\'s a bad idea to leave your bike unlocked in the city, obviously. The Kryptonite New-U New York Lock ($148) features a double deadbolt. For thieves to get your bike, they would have to saw through each arm individually. Most won\\'t bother with the hassle.

       "  'Sam Altman, the 37-year-old startup-minting guru at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom , has long dreamed of a future in which computers could converse and learn like humans. One of his clearest childhood memories is sitting up late in his bedroom in suburban St. Louis, playing with the Macintosh LC II he had gotten for his eighth birthday when he had the sudden realization: \"Someday, the computer was going to learn to think,\" he said. In recent months, Mr. Altman has done more than anyone else to usher in this future—and commercialize it. OpenAI, the company he leads, in November released ChatGPT , the chatbot with an uncanny ability to produce humanlike writing that has become one of the most viral products in the history of technology. In the process, OpenAI went from a small nonprofit into a multibillion-dollar company , at near record speed, thanks in part to the launch of a for-profit arm that enabled it to raise $13 billion from Microsoft Corp., according to investor documents. This success has come as part of a delicate balancing act. Mr. Altman said he fears what could happen if AI is rolled out into society recklessly. He co-founded OpenAI eight years ago as a research nonprofit, arguing that it\\'s uniquely dangerous to have profits be the main driver of developing powerful AI models. He is so wary of profit as an incentive in AI development that he has taken no direct financial stake in the business he built, he said—an anomaly in Silicon Valley, where founders of successful startups typically get rich off their equity. \"Like most other people, I like watching scores go up,\" when it comes to financial gains, he said. \"And I just like not having that be any factor at all.\" (The company said he earns a \"modest\" salary, but declined to disclose how much.) Mr. Altman said he has a small stake in a venture fund that invested in OpenAI, but that it is \"immaterial.\" Mr. Altman said he made \"more money than I could ever need\" early in his career, when he made a fortune investing in young startups. He owns three homes, including a mansion in San Francisco\\'s Russian Hill neighborhood and a weekend home in Napa Valley, and employs a couple dozen to manage them and his family office of investments and nonprofits. During one of his last visits to his grandmother, who died last year, he bought her groceries and then admitted to his mother that he hadn\\'t been to a grocery store in four or five years, she said. His goal, he said, is to forge a new world order in which machines free people to pursue more creative work. In his vision, universal basic income—the concept of a cash stipend for everyone, no strings attached—helps compensate for jobs replaced by AI. Mr. Altman even thinks that humanity will love AI so much that an advanced chatbot could represent \"an extension of your will.\" In the long run, he said, he wants to set up a global governance structure that would oversee decisions about the future of AI and gradually reduce the power OpenAI\\'s executive team has over its technology. Backers say his brand of social-minded capitalism makes him the ideal person to lead OpenAI. Others, including some who\\'ve worked for him, say he\\'s too commercially minded and immersed in Silicon Valley thinking to lead a technological revolution that is already reshaping business and social life. The company signed a $10 billion deal with Microsoft in January that would allow the tech behemoth to own 49% of the company\\'s for-profit entity, investor documents show. The corporate partnership, along with Mr. Altman\\'s push to more aggressively commercialize its technology, have disillusioned key early leaders at OpenAI who felt the decisions violated an initial commitment to develop AI outside the influence of shareholders. One of OpenAI\\'s critics has been Elon Musk, who co-founded the nonprofit in 2015 but parted ways in 2018 after a dispute over its control and direction. The Tesla Inc. CEO tweeted in February that OpenAI had been founded as an open-source nonprofit \"to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft. Not what I intended at all.\" Mr. Altman paused when asked about his co-founder\\'s critique. \"I like Elon,\" he finally responded. \"I pay attention to what he has to say.\" In an open letter made public this week, Mr. Musk and other Silicon Valley luminaries, including Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a six-month pause for developing AI more advanced than GPT-4, the latest technology released by OpenAI in March, to stem a technological race that could spiral out of control. Mr. Altman said he doesn\\'t necessarily need to be first to develop artificial general intelligence, a world long imagined by researchers and science-fiction writers where software isn\\'t just good at one specific task like generating text or images but can understand and learn as well or better than a human can. He instead said OpenAI\\'s ultimate mission is to build AGI, as it\\'s called, safely. OpenAI has set profit caps for investors, with any returns beyond certain levels—from seven to 100 times what they put in, depending on how early they invested—flowing to the nonprofit parent, according to investor documents. OpenAI and Microsoft also created a joint safety board, which includes Mr. Altman and Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott, that has the power to roll back Microsoft and OpenAI product releases if they are deemed too dangerous. The possibilities of AGI have led Mr. Altman to entertain the idea that some similar technology created our universe, according to billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel, a close friend of Mr. Altman\\'s and an early donor to the nonprofit. He has long been a proponent of the idea that humans and machines will one day merge. ChatGPT\\'s release triggered a stream of competing AI announcements. \"They\\'ve raced to release press releases,\" Mr. Altman said of his competitors. \"Obviously, they\\'re behind now.\" Google announced it was testing its own chatbot, Bard, in February and opened access to the public in March. In its founding charter, OpenAI pledged to abandon its research efforts if another project came close to building AGI before it did. The goal, the company said, was to avoid a race toward building dangerous AI systems fueled by competition and instead prioritize the safety of humanity. OpenAI\\'s headquarters, in San Francisco\\'s Mission District, evoke an affluent New Age utopia more than a nonprofit trying to save the world. Stone fountains are nestled amid succulents and ferns in nearly all of the sun-soaked rooms. Mr. Altman gushes about the winding, central staircase he conceived so that all 400 of the company\\'s employees would have a chance to pass each other daily—or at least on the Mondays through Wednesdays they are required to work in-person. The office includes a college-style cafeteria, a self-serve bar and a library modeled after a combination of his favorite bookstore in Paris and the Bender Room, a quiet study space on the top floor of Stanford University\\'s largest library. Dressed in the typical tech CEO uniform of a gray hoodie, jeans and blindingly white sneakers, Mr. Altman described a much more modest upbringing. Mr. Altman grew up in a suburb of St. Louis, the eldest of four children born to Connie Gibstine, a dermatologist, and Jerry Altman, who worked various jobs, including as a lawyer, and died five years ago. The senior Mr. Altman\\'s true vocation was running affordable housing nonprofits, his family said, and he spent years trying to revitalize St. Louis\\'s downtown. Among the lessons his father taught him, Mr. Altman said, was that \"you always help people—even if you don\\'t think you have time, you figure it out.\" Dr. Gibstine said her son was working the family\\'s VCR at age 2 and rebooking his own plane ticket home from camp at 13. By the time he was in third grade, he was helping teachers at his local public school troubleshoot computer problems, she said. In middle school, he transferred to the private John Burroughs School. \"Teachers liked him because he was really, really bright and a hard worker, but he was also super social,\" said Andy Abbott, the head of school, who was a principal at the time. \"He was funny and had a big personality.\" Mr. Altman went on to Stanford, where he did research at an AI lab. By sophomore year he had co-founded Loopt, a location-based social networking service. It became part of the first class of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator that went on to hatch companies like Airbnb Inc., Stripe Inc. and Dropbox Inc., and Mr. Altman left school. Loopt never got traction, selling in 2012 for $43.4 million, or close to the amount investors including Sequoia Capital put in. Mr. Altman then started a venture fund and made powerful allies, including Mr. Thiel and Paul Graham, who co-founded Y Combinator and eventually brought on Mr. Altman. There he helped build the company into a Silicon Valley power broker. He invested his own money in dozens of successful companies early on, including cloud software company Asana Inc. and message-board site Reddit Inc. While running Y Combinator, Mr. Altman began to nurse a growing fear that large research labs like DeepMind, purchased by Google in 2014, were creating potentially dangerous AI technologies outside the public eye. Mr. Musk has voiced similar concerns of a dystopian world controlled by powerful AI machines. Messrs. Altman and Musk decided it was time to start their own lab. Both were part of a group that pledged $1 billion to the nonprofit, OpenAI Inc. Mr. Musk didn\\'t respond to requests for comment. The nonprofit meandered in its early years, experimenting with projects like teaching robots how to perform tasks like solving Rubik\\'s Cubes. OpenAI laid off a chunk of its small staff in 2017. OpenAI researchers soon concluded that the most promising path to achieve artificial general intelligence rested in large language models, or computer programs that mimic the way humans read and write. Such models were trained on large volumes of text and required a massive amount of computing power that OpenAI wasn\\'t equipped to fund as a nonprofit, according to Mr. Altman. \"We didn\\'t have a visceral sense of just how expensive this project was going to be,\" he said. \"We still don\\'t.\" That year, Mr. Altman said he looked into options to raise more money for OpenAI, such as securing federal funding and launching a new cryptocurrency. \"No one wanted to fund this in any way,\" he said. \"It was a really hard time.\" Tensions also grew with Mr. Musk, who became frustrated with the slow progress and pushed for more control over the organization, people familiar with the matter said. OpenAI executives ended up reviving an unusual idea that had been floated earlier in the company\\'s history: creating a for-profit arm, OpenAI LP, that would report to the nonprofit parent. Reid Hoffman, a LinkedIn co-founder who advised OpenAI at the time and later served on the board, said the idea was to attract investors eager to make money from the commercial release of some OpenAI technology, accelerating OpenAI\\'s progress. \"You want to be there first and you want to be setting the norms,\" he said. \"That\\'s part of the reason why speed is a moral and ethical thing here.\" The decision further alienated Mr. Musk, the people familiar with the matter said. He parted ways with OpenAI in February 2018. Mr. Musk announced his departure in a company all-hands, former employees who attended the meeting said. Mr. Musk explained that he thought he had a better chance at creating artificial general intelligence through Tesla, where he had access to greater resources, they said. A young researcher questioned whether Mr. Musk had thought through the safety implications, the former employees said. Mr. Musk grew visibly frustrated and called the intern a \"jackass,\" leaving employees stunned, they said. It was the last time many of them would see Mr. Musk in person. Soon after, an OpenAI executive commissioned a \"jackass\" trophy for the young researcher, which was later presented to him on a pillow. \"You\\'ve got to have a little fun,\" Mr. Altman said. \"This is the stuff that culture gets made out of.\" Mr. Musk\\'s departure marked a turning point. Later that year, OpenAI leaders told employees that Mr. Altman was set to lead the company. He formally became CEO and helped complete the creation of the for-profit subsidiary in early 2019. OpenAI said that it received about $130 million in contributions from the initial $1 billion pledge, but that further donations were no longer needed after the for-profit\\'s creation. Mr. Musk has tweeted that he donated around $100 million to OpenAI. In the meantime, Mr. Altman began hunting for investors. His break came at Allen & Co.\\'s annual conference in Sun Valley, Idaho in the summer of 2018, where he bumped into Satya Nadella, the Microsoft CEO, on a stairwell and pitched him on OpenAI. Mr. Nadella said he was intrigued. The conversations picked up that winter. \"I remember coming back to the team after and I was like, this is the only partner,\" Mr. Altman said. \"They get the safety stuff, they get artificial general intelligence. They have the capital, they have the ability to run the compute.\" Mr. Altman shared the contract with employees as it was being negotiated, hosting all-hands and office hours to allay concerns that the partnership contradicted OpenAI\\'s initial pledge to develop artificial intelligence outside the corporate world, the former employees said. Some employees still saw the deal as a Faustian bargain. OpenAI\\'s lead safety researcher, Dario Amodei, and his lieutenants feared the deal would allow Microsoft to sell products using powerful OpenAI technology before it was put through enough safety testing, former employees said. They felt that OpenAI\\'s technology was far from ready for a large release—let alone with one of the world\\'s largest software companies—worrying it could malfunction or be misused for harm in ways they couldn\\'t predict. Mr. Amodei also worried the deal would tether OpenAI\\'s ship to just one company—Microsoft—making it more difficult for OpenAI to stay true to its founding charter\\'s commitment to assist another project if it got to AGI first, the former employees said. Microsoft initially invested $1 billion in OpenAI. While the deal gave OpenAI its needed money, it came with a hitch: exclusivity. OpenAI agreed to only use Microsoft\\'s giant computer servers, via its Azure cloud service, to train its AI models, and to give the tech giant the sole right to license OpenAI\\'s technology for future products. \"You kind of have to jump off the cliff and hope you land,\" Mr. Nadella said in a recent interview. \"That\\'s kind of how platform shifts happen.\" \"The deal completely undermines those tenets to which they secured nonprofit status,\" said Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of psychology and neural science at New York University who co-founded a machine-learning company. Mr. Altman \"has presided over a 180-degree pivot that seems to me to be only giving lip service to concern for humanity,\" he said. Mr. Altman disagreed. \"The unusual thing about Microsoft as a partner is that it let us keep all the tenets that we think are important to our mission,\" he said, including profit caps and the commitment to assist another project if it got to AGI first. The cash turbocharged OpenAI\\'s progress, giving researchers access to the computing power needed to improve large language models, which were trained on billions of pages of publicly available text. OpenAI soon developed a more powerful language model called GPT-3 and then sold developers access to the technology in June 2020 through packaged lines of code known as application program interfaces, or APIs. Mr. Altman and Mr. Amodei clashed again over the release of the API, former employees said. Mr. Amodei wanted a more limited and staged release of the product to help reduce publicity and allow the safety team to conduct more testing on a smaller group of users, former employees said. Mr. Amodei left the company a few months later along with several others to found a rival AI lab called Anthropic. \"They had a different opinion about how to best get to safe AGI than we did,\" Mr. Altman said. Anthropic has since received more than $300 million from Google this year and released its own AI chatbot called Claude in March, which is also available to developers through an API. In a recent investment deck, Anthropic said it was \"committed to large-scale commercialization\" to achieve the creation of safe AGI, and that it \"fully committed\" to a commercial approach in September. The company was founded as an AI safety and research company and said at the time that it might look to create commercial value from its products. In the three years after the initial deal, Microsoft invested a total of $3 billion in OpenAI, according to investor documents. More than one million users signed up for ChatGPT within five days of its November release, a speed that surprised even Mr. Altman. It followed the company\\'s introduction of DALL-E 2 , which can generate sophisticated images from text prompts. The internet blew up with anecdotes about people using ChatGPT to create sonnets or plan toddler birthday parties. By February, it had reached 100 million users, according to analysts at UBS, the fastest pace by a consumer app in history to reach that mark. Mr. Altman\\'s close associates praise his ability to balance OpenAI\\'s priorities. No one better navigates between the \"Scylla of misplaced idealism\" and the \"Charybdis of myopic ambition,\" Mr. Thiel said. Mr. Altman said he delayed the release of the latest version of its model, GPT-4, from last year to March to run additional safety tests. Users had reported some disturbing experiences with the model, integrated into Bing, where the software hallucinated—meaning it made up answers to questions it didn\\'t know. It issued ominous warnings and made threats. \"The way to get it right is to have people engage with it, explore these systems, study them, to learn how to make them safe,\" Mr. Altman said. After Microsoft\\'s initial investment is paid back, it would capture 49% of OpenAI\\'s profits until the profit cap, up from 21% under prior arrangements, the documents show. OpenAI Inc., the nonprofit parent, would get the rest. Mr. Altman\\'s other projects include Worldcoin, a company he co-founded that seeks to give cryptocurrency to every person on earth. He has put almost all his liquid wealth in recent years in two companies. He has put $375 million into Helion Energy, which is seeking to create carbon-free energy from nuclear fusion and is close to creating \"legitimate net-gain energy in a real demo,\" Mr. Altman said. He has also put $180 million into Retro, which aims to add 10 years to the human lifespan through \"cellular reprogramming, plasma-inspired therapeutics and autophagy,\" or the reuse of old and damaged cell parts, according to the company. He noted how much easier these problems are, morally, than AI. \"If you\\'re making nuclear fusion, it\\'s all upside. It\\'s just good,\" he said. \"If you\\'re making AI, it is potentially very good, potentially very terrible.\" Deepa Seetharaman and Miles Kruppa contributed to this article.',\n",
       "  'WASHINGTON—The Biden administration detailed new criteria for an electric-vehicle tax-credit program , a change that officials said they expect will reduce the number of eligible models. The new rules, issued by the Treasury Department Friday, aim to make the U.S. less reliant on batteries and critical minerals shipped from China. For car buyers to claim the full $7,500 tax credit, the batteries must contain set amounts of components made in North America and critical minerals sourced in the U.S. or from certain friendly countries. The criteria will take effect on April 18, when a list of models that qualify for the tax credit will be issued. Until then, consumers can claim the full tax credit when they buy vehicles that are currently eligible, before some are expected to drop off the list. The program is part of the Inflation Reduction Act, a broad clean-energy, tax and healthcare law passed last year. It is designed to make electric vehicles more affordable and accelerate the shift to clean energy by updating a previous tax-credit program. John Bozzella, president and chief executive of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a top auto industry group, said only few of the electric-vehicle models that are currently for sale will qualify for the full $7,500 credit under the new criteria. Mr. Bozzella added that he doesn\\'t yet know which makes and models will. Individual auto makers will report to the government in the coming days which models meet the mineral and battery-component requirements. Currently, 43% of electric vehicles on the market are eligible for the tax credit, down from 92% before the IRA last August required that vehicles be manufactured in North America, according to the alliance. \"In fact, this period may go down as the high water mark for EV tax credit eligibility since the IRA passed last year,\" Mr. Bozzella said in a blog post. More than 282,000 electric vehicles were sold in the U.S. in the October-December quarter last year, up 51% from a year earlier and making up 8.5% of all vehicle sales, the group said. Steven Schmoll, a director at KPMG, said anyone in the market for an electric vehicle should consider whether the critical mineral and battery component requirements would apply: \"There could be a $7,500 difference between taking possession of an EV on April 17 versus April 18.\" Writing the new rules has been a headache for the Biden administration, under pressure from trading partners that said the legislation would harm their auto makers . Some allies said they are still negotiating with U.S. officials to make sure they are covered by a key aspect of the rules. While companies have increased assembly of electric vehicles and batteries in the U.S., China dominates the global critical-minerals supply . \"Put simply, we want to end this overreliance,\" an administration official said. \"And we now have tools in our tool belt.\" Part of the Inflation Reduction Act\\'s electric-vehicle tax-credit program went into effect on Jan. 1 , without the critical-mineral and battery-component rules. Until mid-April, all electric vehicles assembled in North America and priced below certain levels—$80,000 for sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks, and $55,000 for other vehicles—will be eligible for the full $7,500 credit. Currently, over 20 models qualify. When the new rules kick in, a vehicle will need to meet the critical-mineral rule to be eligible for $3,750 of the tax credit. That requires at least 40% of battery minerals, based on value, to be extracted or processed in the U.S. or countries that have free-trade agreements with the U.S., or recycled in North America. That ratio will rise to 80% by 2027. To qualify for the rest of credit, vehicles will have to meet the battery-component criteria—at least 50% manufactured or assembled in North America, climbing to 100% by 2029. The guidance released Friday spells out how companies should calculate these percentages. The program has income caps of $300,000 for married couples, $225,000 for heads of households and $150,000 for others. Friday\\'s rules make clear that corporations and other entities that don\\'t report adjusted gross income are eligible for the credit, though many may prefer to use a credit for commercial vehicles that has fewer restrictions. A separate program for commercial vehicles offers tax incentives without local-assembly or battery-sourcing requirements, making a wider range of vehicles eligible for the benefit if they are bought by businesses for leasing or rental. Administration officials expect the number of vehicles for which consumers can claim the full tax credit to decline temporarily with the introduction of the new criteria. In the long term, they say new domestic vehicle and battery plants being built by U.S. and foreign companies will mean more cars will be eligible. Since the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act, companies have announced plans to build 75 facilities with a total investment of more than $45 billion, administration officials say. The new proposed rules were rolled out three months after the original target date, as administration officials tried to address concerns raised by trading partners and lawmakers. Although the guidance takes effect next month, it isn\\'t final and will go through a 60-day public-comment period. Some lawmakers say the Treasury Department has interpreted the law too broadly. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), the author of the EV program, criticized the administration\\'s reading of the law in the new rules, saying it allowed for more participation of foreign companies than intended. \"It is horrific that the administration continues to ignore the purpose of the law, which is to bring manufacturing back to America and ensure we have reliable and secure supply chains,\" he said. \"American tax dollars should not be used to support manufacturing jobs overseas.\" The EV rule also has prompted spats with allies, including the European Union, South Korea, Japan and the U.K., which said the local-assembly and battery-sourcing requirements discriminate against their companies. Complaining that the U.S. subsidy program will redirect business investments from Europe to North America, the EU recently beefed up its own clean-energy subsidies . The Treasury Department listed more than 20 countries, including Australia, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, as free-trade agreement countries that qualify under the critical-minerals rule. While a recent announcement to forge a bilateral critical-minerals agreement added Japan to the list, the EU and the U.K. remain ineligible. \"We\\'re quite optimistic that we can reach an agreement of the same sort of substantial scope as the Japanese,\" Margrethe Vestager, the EU\\'s executive vice president and commissioner for competition, said Thursday. Ms. Vestager met Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in Washington Friday. The deal with Japan has drawn pushback from some lawmakers. House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R., Mo.) said the administration was negotiating \"fake trade agreements in secret without approval by Congress.\" The administration will later issue guidance on another key aspect of the electric-vehicle program: a rule on \"foreign entities of concern,\" which will make vehicles ineligible for the tax credits starting next year if their batteries contain any components or critical minerals sourced from an entity linked to China or other adversaries. This is seen as an especially high hurdle for auto makers, as numerous joint-venture operations between companies from China and companies from the U.S. and friendly nations currently play significant roles in EV-battery supply chains. —Andrew Duehren contributed to this article.',\n",
       "  'Wall Street projected an oil bonanza this year. The first quarter upended those expectations. Russia has continued pumping out petroleum despite Western sanctions . The U.S. market has remained awash in crude after the conclusion of the Biden administration\\'s emergency release of oil reserves . And a Chinese rebound that underpinned some analysts\\' predictions of a commodity boom has yet to juice global demand. Instead, the oil producers and traders that captured monster profits in 2022 are now weighing whether a slowdown in the U.S. and Europe is coming sooner rather than later—if it comes at all. The tremors at Western bank s in March magnified that uncertainty , leaving investors wading through complicated crosscurrents running from financial markets to the real world. The banking stress led to oil\\'s steepest weekly selloff since the beginning of the pandemic and took some of the sheen off energy stocks, one of the market\\'s major winners in 2022. The S&P 500 energy sector slid 5.6% in the first quarter, according to FactSet, a decline outpaced only by financial stocks. Some investors now fear that crude\\'s China-driven rally could be slowed by an unpredictable outlook for U.S. and European industries heavily reliant on gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Khendry Veras, a vice president at On Time Logistics, a family-owned trucking company in Newark, N.J., said falling fuel costs in recent months haven\\'t made up for dwindling shipping-container deliveries for its fleet of 40 semitrailers that haul freight up and down the East Coast. \"We\\'re doing our best to hold on,\" Mr. Veras said. During a year in which many on Wall Street projected the value of oil to jump, allowing the energy industry to shower shareholders with more cash, the outlook of oil-and-gas executives has turned negative, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey of 147 companies. Benchmark U.S. prices, meanwhile, have slipped 5.7%. \"The price moves that we\\'ve seen have played out because, to a good extent, the elements that were expected to be bullish have turned out to be bearish,\" said Matt Smith, an analyst at the ship-tracking firm Kpler. For now, many physical trading houses and hedge funds that speculate on oil continue to see upside in China, parsing shipping routes, traffic patterns and air-travel numbers for hints that its postpandemic recovery is gaining steam. The country imported nearly 11.4 million barrels of seaborne oil a day in March, according to Kpler, the second-highest monthly total the firm has recorded. A hiring spree of skyscraper-size supertankers in the coming weeks suggests the uptick could continue. \"It\\'s picking up,\" said Cyril Ducau, chief executive of Singapore-based Eastern Pacific Shipping, which commands a 225-vessel fleet, pointing to growing imports of oil, refined fuel and iron ore. Many investors remain optimistic China will help the broader energy sector continue to pass out dividends and stock buybacks throughout 2023. \"You look at the second half of the year, and global oil demand is reaching all-time highs,\" said Rob Thummel, managing director at Tortoise, an energy-investment firm. For some traders, the big question is whether China\\'s appetite for oil will grow—boosting prices—before the U.S. and European hunger for energy subsides. In the U.S., the overall economy continues to chug along. Fears of broader contagion from the banking stress have receded, and stock markets have rebounded. The Federal Reserve at its meeting in March continued to raise interest rates to cool inflation. But petroleum analysts see at least one warning sign for energy markets. Demand for diesel has dropped nearly 12% from a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration, contributing to unusual growth in U.S. oil stockpiles for much of 2023. That slip in demand has come as some diesel-reliant industries have seen a drop in borrowing and business activity. Companies in construction, agriculture, and metals and mining last year sold less than half the bonds they did in 2021, according to PitchBook LCD, suggesting that financing for new projects is tightening. The manufacturing sector in February reported its sixth straight month of declining orders for products such as carpeting, furniture and appliances. Rising rates have slammed mortgage lending and forced home-building companies to pull back from single-family-home jobs, idling work vehicles and diesel-driven equipment including excavators. \"The single-family housing segment is in its own recession,\" said Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, a construction-industry trade group. Imports from container ships tumbled in recent months as retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corp., Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. pulled back on orders . In Newark, On Time Logistics has responded by cutting employees\\' hours and bracing for furloughs or layoffs if things don\\'t improve. Mr. Veras said the company spent as much as $40,000 a week fueling up on diesel last summer, when there was a steady need for trucks to carry containers of nails, marble and other freight. Diesel\\'s cost per gallon has slid since then, but the number of trips made by On Time Logistics—and the amount of diesel its vehicles use—has dropped even faster. Now, Mr. Veras said, the company\\'s weekly fuel costs have plunged to $10,000 or $15,000. But he is optimistic business will pick back up heading into summer. \"It has got to get better from here on out,\" he said.',\n",
       "  'Core inflation in the eurozone hit a record in March, a setback for central bankers whose rapid interest-rate rises have exacerbated financial sector strains and caused pains in part of the bloc\\'s economy. The fresh data increases the likelihood that the European Central Bank will raise its key rate again in May. It could also encourage governments to explore alternative ways to cool prices rises by targeting inflationary increases in profits. The European Union\\'s statistics agency said consumer prices in the eurozone were 6.9% higher in March than a year earlier, a decline from the 8.5% rate of inflation recorded in February and the lowest in just over a year. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal last week had expected to see a decline to 7.1%. The sharp fall in the annual inflation rate was driven by energy prices, which surged in March last year after Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, but have since fallen back. The core rate of inflation however, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose to 5.7% from 5.6%, reaching the highest level since records began in 2001. Central bankers tend to focus on core inflation as an indication of whether rate rises are cooling inflation since it better reflects the balance of demand and supply in the economy. \"This reinforces our view that the ECB will keep hiking in the coming months despite some financial stability concerns,\" economists at HSBC said. As they consider their next steps, policy makers will be aware that further rate rises risk deepening strains in the European banking system. These strains could amplify the impact of interest-rate rises by leading to a sharper decline in lending to businesses and households than the ECB had anticipated. This added stress in the banking system came into sharp relief when Credit Suisse Group AG, weakened by years of scandals and trading losses, came under intense market pressure, prompting Swiss regulators to engineer UBS Group AG\\'s takeover of its rival . That followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the U.S., which brought the challenges of adjusting to a sharp rise in interest rates into focus. Policy makers have long been concerned that the surge in energy and food prices after the invasion of Ukraine would lead to an increase in pay rises, in turn prompting businesses to raise their prices and setting off a fresh round of pay demands. Some ECB rate setters are now also looking at the inflationary potential of widening profit margins, with one official warning of a \"profit-price spiral.\" \"Opportunistic behavior by firms could also delay the fall in core inflation,\" said Fabio Panetta last week. ECB President Christine Lagarde has echoed that concern, saying that a refusal on the part of business owners—not just workers—to accept a decline in their real incomes could entrench high inflation. Since the eurozone imports most of its energy, the sharp rise in energy prices since the months leading up to the invasion of Ukraine is a transfer of resources out of the currency area and to energy suppliers such as Norway, the U.S. and Qatar. In 2022, the European Union\\'s energy imports cost 833.7 billion euros—equivalent to around $909 billion—more than double the €390.3 billion bill for 2021, despite a decline in energy consumption. Eurozone policy makers often compare that loss of resources to a tax rise, and Ms. Lagarde said a sharing of that burden between workers and business owners would help contain inflation. \"It is certainly something that we would welcome, to the extent that it reduces the risk of second-round effects in particular,\" she said earlier this month. Eurozone wages rose at an annual pace of 5.1% during the last quarter of 2022, the fastest rise since records began in 1996, with the exception of the second quarter of 2021, which was boosted by one-off pandemic-related effects. Encouraged by an unemployment rate that fell back to a record low of 6.6% in February, some workers seeking larger pay rises have resorted to strikes. In one of Germany\\'s biggest walkouts in decades, a large-scale transport strike brought large parts of the country to a standstill on Monday as two labor unions sought raises of 10.5% and 12% respectively. Data through the end of 2022 show profits have been rising faster than wages over recent years. And according to the ECB, profits accounted for a larger share of the rise in prices of goods and services than did wages during the final six months of last year. Sectors where the growth in profits has outstripped the growth in wages include manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, accommodation and food services. \"It looks to me as if this inflation shock has encouraged some of these companies to beef up their margins,\" said Claus Vistesen, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Some business owners have said that price rises that exceed cost increases allow companies to keep prices stable, instead of burdening customers with recurrent price increases that closely track inflation. Central bankers don\\'t have any direct way to cool rising profits other than through higher interest rates that weaken demand. Governments can use taxes to cap profit increases more directly. Economists have long pointed to a lack of competition in many of the eurozone\\'s services industries as a drag on growth, but this may now be enabling businesses to claim wider profit margins. \"If there is not enough competition, it\\'s time for regulators to take stock and do something about it,\" said Alvaro Pereira, chief economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. However, regulatory changes can take time to have an impact and ECB policy makers don\\'t appear to be prepared to wait. \"Margin compression will have to happen, playing an important role in the disinflation process,\" said Marco Valli, global head of research at Italy\\'s UniCredit. \"The longer it takes to get there, the higher the risk that the ECB would need to tighten aggressively, pushing the eurozone into the nasty-recession scenario.\"',\n",
       "  'After years of uncertainty, last year\\'s Inflation Reduction Act finally gave America\\'s renewable-energy industry a long, green signal. Now the economy is blocking the road. The wind and solar industries have always suffered from the short-term nature of subsidies, with federal tax credits often extended in nail-biting one-year increments. Last year\\'s climate bill changed that, giving the industry subsidies that last at least a decade. But just as policy winds blow in their favor, two critical growth drivers—interest rates and equipment costs—are moving in the wrong direction. Wind and solar projects are especially sensitive to rates because debt can comprise as much as 85% to 90% of capital expenditures. Renewable developers have known only low rates for most of their history. Nearly all U.S. utility-scale solar facilities and 85% of onshore wind farms were installed since 2009, during which period the target federal-funds rate was close to 0% in eight out of 13 years. Not any more: After the most recent hike , rates are the highest since 2007. Renewable energy projects tend to be financed with floating-rate loans that rise and fall with the benchmark interest rate. Thankfully, most of those projects are well-shielded from rate risk because lenders require them to hedge at least 75% of their loans through swaps, according to Elizabeth Waters, managing director of project finance at MUFG. Most ended up hedging 90-95% to lock in low rates, she noted. But those swaps won\\'t help new projects. Some new solar and wind projects facing higher borrowing costs than when they were planned might not make it off the drawing board. Borrowing isn\\'t the only thing that costs more. Following years of price declines thanks to technology and economies of scale, equipment is getting more expensive too. Trade policies aimed at Chinese manufacturers have caused delays and shortages for the solar industry, which relies heavily on the country for its components. German utility RWE, an active developer in the U.S., said in its annual report released last week that imports of solar modules from Asia are now subject to \"stringent checks\" and said it could fall behind on its expansion plans if the U.S. continues to \"impede the procurement of solar panels.\" After falling to a record low in 2020, the average price of a solar photovoltaic system rose in 2021 and then again in 2022, according to data from the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie. Meanwhile, the average cost to build an onshore wind farm in the U.S. rose in 2020 and 2021 before leveling off last year, according to data from BloombergNEF. Supply-chain issues and interconnection delays already started slowing the clean power industry last year: In 2022 it installed 25.1 Gigawatts of total capacity, a 16% decline from a year earlier, according to the American Clean Power Association, which tracks solar, wind and energy storage. While that\\'s still enough to meet roughly half of Texas\\' electricity demand, it was nonetheless below expectations–though part of the drop was driven by an preplanned phase-down for tax credits commonly used by the wind industry before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed. Ultimately, solar and wind\\'s ability to absorb cost and interest-rate hikes depends on how willing utilities and corporations are to pay higher prices. Many onshore wind and solar projects have been able to renegotiate pricing on their power purchase agreements because demand is robust, according to industry executives. But cracks are showing for offshore wind, which is more exposed to rising costs and rates because it takes longer to develop. BloombergNEF estimates that the weighted average cost of capital for U.S. offshore wind projects rose to 5.25% in 2022 from 4.41% in 2020. Developer Avangrid Renewables, for example, is trying to terminate its power purchase agreement with utilities in Massachusetts for a 1.2 Gigawatt offshore wind project after an unsuccessful attempt at renegotiating its fixed-price contract. If built, Commonwealth Wind would generate enough energy to power 700,000 homes. The company cited \"historic price increases for global commodities, sharp and sudden increases in interest rates, prolonged supply chain constraints, and persistent inflation\" since the project secured a contract in late 2021. Avangrid plans to bid the same project into the state\\'s next competitive offshore wind procurement, a spokesman said over email. Danish power company Orsted said in its annual report released February that it incurred an impairment of 2.5 billion Danish kroner, the equivalent of $369 million, on its 50% interest in the Sunrise Wind project off the coast of New York, noting that the project cost has increased substantially since its bid in 2019. As the name implies, the Inflation Reduction Act is supposed to relieve some of these cost pressures. But it won\\'t feel like a bonanza without clarity on how the rules apply. Expanding the eligibility of tax credits to more technologies, for example, has spread the limited pool of tax equity investors—that is, those with both the tax burden and the know-how to use renewable tax credits—more thinly across more projects. Ironically, that has shrunk the pool of tax equity available to solar and wind in the near term. The bill tries to address this by making such tax credits transferable, but industry executives said that pool of capital will remain constrained until there is more guidance. A solar site in Lumpkin, Ga. PHOTO: Audra Melton for The Wall Street Journal There are two other more recent developments worth watching: One is the plummeting cost of natural gas which, if prolonged, could impact demand for solar and wind on the margins. The U.S. benchmark Henry Hub has fallen 49% year to date. Secondly, banks\\' recent turmoil could shrink their ability to lend. Ted Brandt, chief executive of clean-energy focused investment bank Marathon Capital, notes that the industry has always had cheap debt, cheap equity and \"massive liquidity chasing it.\" How the industry will respond to expensive capital is still an open question, he said. It isn\\'t enough for policy winds to blow in the right direction for a renewable energy boom–economic headwinds need to abate too.',\n",
       "  'Consumer spending rose more modestly in February after a sharp jump at the start of the year, while inflation cooled but remained elevated. Households boosted their spending by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in February from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Friday. That followed a revised 2% increase in January, but economists said the two months viewed together represented a solid gain as 2023 got under way. \"February\\'s consumer spending numbers should be viewed as quite strong,\" said Pooja Sriram, U.S. economist at Barclays. \"Households continue to feel the tailwind from strong gains in wages and salaries, fueled by strong labor demand, and continue to dip into excess savings accumulated during the pandemic for additional firepower.\" Inflation continued to take a bite out of spending power, however. When adjusted for rising prices, household spending fell 0.1% in February from the prior month, after rising a revised 1.5% in January. The February figures don\\'t reflect any impact on consumer spending from banking industry turmoil , which emerged in March. Inflation eased in February, though it remains significantly above the Federal Reserve\\'s 2% target. The personal consumption-expenditures price index climbed 5% in February from a year earlier, down from 5.3% in January. The core-PCE price index—which omits volatile food and energy prices—rose 4.6% in February from a year earlier, compared with 4.7% the prior month. The Fed sees the core measure as a better predictor of future inflation. U.S. stocks rose on Friday after the softer inflation and spending figures. The Fed raised short-term interest rates by a quarter-percentage point on March 22, its ninth straight increase aimed at curbing inflation by slowing the economy. It lifted its benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 4.75% and 5%, the highest level since September 2007. Though inflation remains high, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the central bank could stop raising interest rates sooner than previously thought if the recent banking system stress triggers a pullback in lending. In the weeks before the banking crisis, the economy showed surprising strength despite the Fed\\'s rate increases. Employers added a seasonally adjusted 311,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate was 3.6%, near historic lows, the Labor Department said. Home sales rose in February from the prior month for the first time in a year. Early signs indicate that the economy stayed on a solid track in March. S urveys showed that U.S. business activity picked up along with consumer confidence in the economic outlook. Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, are hovering near historically low levels . But banking tumult—and tighter lending that might result—will influence business investments more directly than consumer spending, said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. With consumer spending accounting for around two-thirds of output, a strong labor market translates to a resilient economy, economists said. \"Even though we\\'re seeing layoffs in tech, with unemployment at 3.6%, what you have is that people who want jobs can get jobs,\" said Leo Feler, chief economist at Numerator, a consumer insights and data company. \"That means households have income and spending power.\" Consumers\\' spending accounts for around two-thirds of U.S. economic output, making it the key to growth. Their spending on goods rose 3.7% in February from December, lifted by increased outlays on furniture, electronics and pleasure boats. Spending on services picked up 1.5% in the same period, as consumers shelled out more on air travel and at movie theaters, restaurants and amusement parks. Household finances also got a boost in February, the Commerce report showed. Income rose 0.3% in February from the prior month, pushed up by increasing wages for service sector workers in particular, said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. And the personal saving rate was 4.6% in February, the highest in more than a year. Chandler Atkins, owner of Elms Waterfront Cottages in Lake Luzerne, N.Y., said bookings are as strong as last year with people visiting from across the country. When the economy turns down, New Yorkers tend to dominate bookings as they dial back more ambitious travel plans, he said. But when times are good, those from farther afield pick up. \"I just took a couple bookings yesterday from people in California,\" he said. \"They must feel that the economy is strong enough and they\\'re not facing recession stress right now. Inflation is coming down right now, even though it\\'s happening slowly. It\\'s causing people to feel like things are getting better, not worse, I think.\" Mr. Atkins is expanding his business, launching a new lodging and events venue and an all-terrain vehicle track on Memorial Day. He is keeping an eye on banking industry troubles but isn\\'t overly concerned. \"I don\\'t think that\\'s really going to have an impact on the vacationer this year,\" he said. Solid consumer demand is putting price pressure on services, as consumers shell out on sporting events, concerts, packaged tours, restaurants and other recreation, said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors Inc. \"The price increases for some of these recreation services are just astronomical,\" he said. \"People are slowing their spending overall but basically, companies are able to pass on some more price increases because people are willing to pay.\" Still, higher prices are driving some consumers to seek to cut costs—sometimes in dramatic ways. John Johnson, a 39-year-old mechanical engineer, is fleeing the Washington, D.C. suburbs for Pittsburgh in May in search of a lower cost of living. He and his wife, Elizabeth, had settled in Takoma Park, Md., eight years ago due to its proximity to public transit. But her job is now fully remote, and the neighborhood is relatively pricey. \"Last night we went out and paid $8 for a beer—you can buy a decent bottle of wine for something like that. And even though inflation is 6%, restaurants are 20% or 30% more expensive,\" he said. \"We\\'ve both had pay increases over the past three or four years, but those gains have evened out or even gone negative.\" The couple made plans to renovate their kitchen due to spending more time cooking at home since the pandemic. But they struggled to find contractors and, when they did, couldn\\'t afford the high prices. That is when Mr. Johnson started looking for a job elsewhere. \"The house we\\'re getting in Pittsburgh is pretty much three times bigger than our current house, and only 25% more expensive,\" he said.',\n",
       "  'Markets showed their resilience in the first quarter, despite being rocked by shock waves that few anticipated . Investors began the year feeling largely upbeat. Inflation appeared to be subsiding, and many bet that would lead the Federal Reserve to switch quickly from raising interest rates to cutting them. Then economic data started coming in hot. Stocks and bond prices slid, hit by worries that the Fed would likely have to keep rates higher for longer. The biggest shock of the quarter came in March, when Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. Bank stocks tumbled. Credit Suisse Group AG came to the brink of failure, forcing rival bank UBS Group AG to arrange a hasty takeover. The biggest U.S. banks scrambled to shore up First Republic Bank to stop growing panic from taking down more lenders. In the face of significant uncertainty, markets proved to be more buoyant than many investors thought possible. The S&P 500 rose 7% in the first quarter, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite soared. The technology-heavy index jumped 17%, outperforming the Dow industrials by the widest margin since 2001. Overall, it was Nasdaq\\'s best quarter since the second quarter of 2020. Meanwhile, bond prices climbed . The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which influences everything from mortgage rates to student loans, fell to 3.491% from 3.826% at the end of 2022. That marks its biggest quarterly decline 2020. What explains the relative calm in markets? \"Things have been better than many feared,\" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Asset Management. A widely anticipated recession has failed to materialize, at least so far. The labor market has remained robust, even with a pickup in layoffs in the technology sector in recent months. And inflation, while still high, has continued to ease. Data showed consumer prices rose 6% from a year earlier in February, the smallest annual gain since September 2021. The combination of factors has helped investors including Mr. Freedman to stay somewhat optimistic—although he is still advising clients to stick to higher-quality companies within credit markets. \"We don\\'t think we are out of the woods yet,\" Mr. Freedman said. Some investors and analysts, for instance, are wary of the risk that markets will be proved wrong about where the Fed will take interest rates the rest of the year. Recent projections show Fed officials expect the federal-funds rate to rise to at least 5.1% from its current range of 4.75% to 5%. That suggests the Fed could push through one more quarter-point interest-rate increase and then hold rates at that level for the remainder of the year. Yet Wall Street has once again grown more confident that the Fed will begin cutting rates as soon as the second half. Derivatives markets show traders expect the federal-funds rate to peak at around 4.9% in May, then fall to about 4.4% by the end of the year, according to FactSet. \"There\\'s a disconnect between market expectations for the Fed and what the Fed is saying,\" said Michelle Cluver, portfolio strategist at Global X ETFs, who attributed the bets on rate cuts in part to the fallout from the banking crisis in March. Heightened expectations for rate cuts have driven investors into many of the stocks that were among the worst hit in last year\\'s market selloff. Nvidia Corp. soared 90% in the first quarter, while Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. rose 76% and Tesla Inc. climbed 68%. Bitcoin also jumped. The cryptocurrency traded above $28,000 on Friday, up around 71% for the quarter. Meanwhile, many of last year\\'s biggest winners have lagged behind. Energy stocks , which soared in 2022, fell in the first quarter. So did crude oil prices. Analysts and investors are divided on how long that reversion will last. \"I do believe there may need to be repricing from markets on where rates are going to be,\" Ms. Cluver said. At the moment, with the crisis in the banking sector looking relatively contained, there doesn\\'t seem to be a strong reason for the Fed to cut rates in the near future, she added. For some, the biggest question remains how well the economy will hold up under the strain of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions . \"I don\\'t think anyone can really answer with certainty if we\\'re entirely through a challenging period,\" said Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco. So far, the economy has held up better than many had expected. If there is a recession within the year, it seems likely it would be relatively mild, Mr. Levitt said. \"The challenge is seeing if there\\'s something lurking that makes it more severe,\" he said.',\n",
       "  'Coal prices have come crashing down from last year\\'s records. Central Appalachian coal has been trading at $88.80 a short ton, down 57% from the record $205.55 at the start of the year. Cash prices for thermal coal mined from northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin -- two places where a lot of exported coal originates -- have fallen more than half since September, when Europe was stocking up for winter. Futures for coal that is shipped around the Pacific from an Australian export facility have made a similar plunge. Coal markets are highly influenced by those for natural gas, which is also burned to generate electricity. As with coal, natural-gas inventories that looked alarmingly low last summer recovered thanks to unusually warm winter weather that obviated a lot of demand for heating. Natural-gas futures for May delivery ended Thursday at $2.104 per million British thermal unit, down 63% from a year ago. Even after the decline in coal prices, varieties produced in the Eastern U.S. have lately cost between $3.10 to $3.55 per million BTUs, according to the Energy Information Administration. That suggests that coal prices might have to fall further to regain competitiveness with natural gas. Coal also faces increased competition from renewables, including wind, solar, hydropower and biomass, which last year accounted for more U.S. power generation than coal for the first time ever, federal record keepers say. Coal remains expensive relative to prepandemic prices, but its rapid deflation shows that power producers around the world are confident enough in their supplies to stop bidding up cargoes. \"We went from undersupplied to oversupplied very quickly,\" said Andy Blumenfeld, data analytics director at McCloskey by OPIS, a pricing service that is part of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co. Prices started surging in 2021, when producers fired up coal-burning generators to keep air conditioners running during some of the hottest temperatures on record. Stockpiles at U.S. power plants shrank to their lowest since the Nixon administration. A ban on Russian exports following the invasion of Ukraine further crimped supplies, while the highest natural-gas prices in years and the prospect of shortages pushed up what power generators were willing to pay for coal. By the summer of 2022 -- another scorcher -- power producers on both sides of the Atlantic were competing for a limited supply of unsold coal. North American power generators\\' stockpiles dwindled to as little as 58 days\\' worth of coal, nearly a month less than the five-year average, according to energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. Congestion at ports and along rail lines ensnared cargoes, prompting grid operators and utilities to take unusual steps to curtail coal use before the weather turned cold. In Colorado, Xcel Energy Inc.\\'s state subsidiary dialed back how much coal it burned in favor of natural gas, even as the competing fuel\\'s price spiked to shale-era highs. \"Given the fact that we were seeing delays and shortages in the delivery of coal, we made the prudent call that we would use less coal so that we could conserve that in advance of the winter heating season,\" said Robert Kenney, president of Xcel Energy\\'s Colorado arm. Warm winter weather left a lot of coal unburned, though. Between December and January U.S. inventories grew by 4.6% at a time of year when they typically decline, according to EIA data. As they raced to stock up, utilities ordered all the coal they could, much of which is scheduled to be delivered this year and could create a glut, analysts say. For decades coal was the primary fuel burned to generate electricity in the U.S. Since 2010, though, U.S. coal-fired generating capacity has dropped more than 36% amid concerns about emissions and the abundance of gas unleashed by the shale-drilling boom, according to FactSet. Power plant owners are expected to retire an additional 4.5% of coal-fired capacity this year, according to the EIA. As coal-burning capacity has dwindled, so has financing for speculative production. Miners now sell most of their output in advance, with not much more to sell if demand is greater than expected. Big mining companies have told investors that they are mostly sold out for 2023. It is possible that power producers have overbought and will try to resell their coal in export markets or renegotiate deals with their suppliers, which could add downward pressure to prices, McCloskey\\'s Mr. Blumenfeld said. Already, he said, some utilities are burning coal to make space for incoming deliveries even though it has become uneconomical.',\n",
       "  'The Biden administration condemned the detention of a Wall Street Journal reporter in Russia for what Moscow described as espionage, the first such case of an American journalist detained for allegations of spying since the Cold War. The arrest of 31-year-old Evan Gershkovich, a Russian speaker whose parents came to the U.S. from the Soviet Union, marked the latest diplomatic flashpoint between Moscow and Washington. The two countries, already on opposite sides of a war in Ukraine, have also clashed over the arrests of each other\\'s citizens and the state of nuclear-arms treaties. President Biden was briefed on the detention of Mr. Gershkovich, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. She reiterated earlier State Department warnings that Americans are urged to avoid traveling to Russia. \"We\\'ve been very clear about Americans not going to Russia. It is not safe,\" Ms. Jean-Pierre said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. seeks immediate consular access to Mr. Gershkovich so it can provide the appropriate support. \"In the strongest possible terms, we condemn the Kremlin\\'s continued attempts to intimidate, repress, and punish journalists and civil society voices,\" Mr. Blinken said. Russia\\'s main security agency on Thursday said it had detained Mr. Gershkovich in the city of Yekaterinburg, around 800 miles east of Moscow, on Wednesday while he was on a reporting trip, accusing him of espionage. \"The Wall Street Journal vehemently denies the allegations from the FSB and seeks the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter, Evan Gershkovich,\" the Journal said. \"We stand in solidarity with Evan and his family.\" National Security Council Strategic Coordinator John Kirby said it wasn\\'t immediately clear if Mr. Gershkovich\\'s detention was coordinated with Russian leadership, or aimed as retaliation for other grievances. Last week, Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov, 37, a Russian national, was charged in a U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., with acting as an agent of a foreign power, visa fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud and other charges stemming from his alleged illegal activities in the U.S., according to the Justice Department. Russia\\'s Federal Security Bureau said Mr. Gershkovich, \"acting on the instructions of the American side, collected information constituting a state secret about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex.\" Mr. Gershkovich is accredited to work as a journalist in Russia by the country\\'s Foreign Ministry. Authorities took Mr. Gershkovich to Moscow, where he appeared in court with a state-appointed defense attorney and was ordered held in custody until May 29, said the press service of the court, according to state news agency TASS. In Russia, espionage trials are often conducted in secret and it is rare for a court to acquit a defendant. Trials can take months to unfold. \"It\\'s a new low in the U.S.-Russia relationship,\" said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. The arrest of an accredited American reporter \"is really setting a precedent.\" Former Vice President Mike Pence called on the Biden administration to expel Russian diplomats from the U.S. \"It\\'s time for the Biden administration to make it clear with Putin that we\\'re not going to put up with his provocations, we\\'re not going to put up with bullying reporters,\" said Mr. Pence on CNN Thursday. Mr. Pence is considering running for the GOP presidential nomination in 2024. In December, the U.S. released convicted Russian arms-trafficker Viktor Bout in an exchange for U.S. women\\'s basketball star Brittney Griner, whom Russian authorities had detained in the days before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. She was found to be carrying hashish oil in her luggage and was later convicted of drug smuggling and possession. Ms. Griner was sentenced to nine years in a penal colony. The White House and the Kremlin remain entangled over Russia\\'s detention since 2018 of former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan on espionage charges. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, asked about the chance of an exchange for Mr. Gershkovich, said it was premature to discuss the issue. \"I would not even raise the question right now\" because past exchanges involved people already serving sentences, Mr. Ryabkov was quoted by state newswire RIA Novosti as saying on Thursday. \"We\\'ll see how this story develops further.\" Mr. Gershkovich\\'s detention sparked a diplomatic outcry from countries that viewed Russia\\'s actions as unacceptable and a reflection of Russia\\'s systemic indifference to media freedom. Dame Karen Pierce, the British ambassador to Washington, said the incident reflects Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s \"total disregard for basic freedoms.\" Josep Borrell Fontelles, the high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy, said that \"journalists must be allowed to exercise their profession freely and deserve protection.\" Mr. Gershkovich dropped out of contact with his editors while working in Yekaterinburg on Wednesday afternoon. A post later appeared on Telegram describing a man with his face hidden being bundled from a restaurant in the city and put into a waiting van. It couldn\\'t be determined whether the person was Mr. Gershkovich. A lawyer hired by the Journal attempted to find Mr. Gershkovich at the FSB building in Yekaterinburg, but was told authorities had no information about him. Mr. Gershkovich subsequently surfaced in Moscow, where he was represented by a court-appointed lawyer. TASS, which cited unnamed sources, reported that Mr. Gershkovich pleaded not guilty at the closed hearing. His case, according to TASS, is considered top secret. Mr. Gershkovich joined the Journal in January 2022. He has worked as a reporter in Russia since 2017, first for the Moscow Times and then for Agence France-Presse. Earlier, he was a news assistant in New York for the New York Times. A graduate of Bowdoin College, he most recently wrote about the impact of Western sanctions on Russia\\'s economy. Friends and colleagues know him as an enterprising journalist who tackled his new role with energy and courage at a time when covering Mr. Putin\\'s Russia grew more difficult amid a contracting space for freedom of expression and media. \"It was becoming such a frustrating job, and here comes Evan, so full of energy,\" said Nataliya Vasilyeva, a correspondent for Britain\\'s Telegraph who knew Mr. Gershkovich in Moscow. \"It was so amazing to watch him, who didn\\'t have this baggage.\" Mr. Gershkovich was born to a father from Odessa and a mother from St. Petersburg, both Jewish immigrants who settled in the U.S. after leaving the Soviet Union. He mastered the Russian language as an adult living in Moscow, according to friends and colleagues. His understanding of the language and affinity for the Russian people gave him an advantage as a journalist, colleagues said. \"He knew he was American but he also felt very much at home. He traveled around Russia, he felt he was a Moscovite,\" said Ms. Vasilyeva. Reporting in Russia has become much more difficult since Mr. Putin in February last year launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine and then cracked down on domestic dissent. Russia last March passed a censorship law that makes it illegal to publish what authorities deem false information about military operations in Ukraine. In response, many domestic news outlets ceased operations or left the country, and foreign media significantly restricted reporting inside Russia and withdrew many staff. Mr. Putin in October tightened restrictions across Russian society with a presidential decree granting local governments in the country\\'s regions new authority to address security concerns. The measures were aimed at maintaining public order, boosting industrial production in support of the military campaign and protecting critical infrastructure, Mr. Putin said at the time. Media-freedom advocacy groups criticized Mr. Gershkovich\\'s detention, which is the first of a foreign journalist since Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine last year, according to Reporters Without Borders. The France-based group is \"alarmed by what looks like retaliation against journalists,\" said spokeswoman Pauline Ades-Mevel. \"Journalists must not be targeted, even if unfortunately they have been regularly since the invasion.\" Mr. Gershkovich is the first U.S. journalist detained on espionage charges in Russia that the Committee to Protect Journalists has documented since the 1986 detention of Nicholas Daniloff. \"CPJ is deeply concerned by the arrest of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. This is the latest in a long line of attempts by Russia to use national security laws to silence reporting. We urge his immediate release,\" said CPJ President Jodie Ginsberg. According to CPJ, 363 journalists were imprisoned around the world as of December, including 199 held on allegations of \"antistate\" activities. Wall Street Journal reporters have been detained in other countries, but rarely, if ever, formally arrested. Reporter Dion Nissenbaum in 2016 was detained in Istanbul for more than two days over a social-media post and then released by Turkish authorities without being charged. In China, over recent decades many Journal reporters have been detained for brief periods, and, in 2020, almost all Journal reporters were expelled. In 1987, Cairo-based reporter Gerald Seib was detained for several days in Iran after being invited by the government and accused of being a Zionist spy traveling on a fake passport. Iranian officials later said his detention resulted from a misunderstanding. Mr. Gershkovich since joining the Journal has covered a variety of Russia-related topics, including the recent visit by Chinese leader Xi Jinping to Moscow, close associates of Mr. Putin and tensions between Kremlin officials and Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of Russian paramilitary group Wagner. After initially withdrawing their correspondents from the country early in the war, some news organizations have restored their Russia-based reporters, and the Russian Foreign Ministry has continued to extend accreditation to some foreign journalists. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday said \"those who carry out normal journalistic activities, of course, if they have valid accreditation, they will continue to work.\" --- Sam Schechner, Sabrina Siddiqui, Georgi Kantchev and Eliza Collins contributed to this article.',\n",
       "  'Before the NCAA women\\'s basketball tournament began, oddsmakers said South Carolina had a 73.3% chance of winning. Not winning its first game or two, but the whole thing, meaning six in a row including the championship. Anyone who\\'s scratched out a bracket for the 68-team men\\'s or women\\'s tournaments -- only to see it turn to garden mulch by Day 3 -- knows that odds like those aren\\'t just rare. They\\'re downright preposterous. And yet here are the No. 1 seeded Gamecocks, headed to their third consecutive Final Four and what they hope will be their second consecutive national title. On Friday they\\'ll face sharpshooting Caitlin Clark and No. 2 seed Iowa in a matchup that\\'s the hottest ticket on record: On Wednesday, tickets for the semifinals in Dallas were reselling for $272, the highest average for a Women\\'s Final Four entry since ticket marketplace Vivid Seats started tracking data in 2010. Although South Carolina has its share of stars -- most notably 2022 national player of the year Aliyah Boston -- Coach Dawn Staley\\'s squad is more remarkable for its colossal sturdiness. The Gamecocks are on a 42-game winning streak dating to last season. They\\'re balanced on both ends of the floor, the nation\\'s top team in rebounding and blocked shots. But where South Carolina really crushes souls is in the waves of reinforcements it can send at opponents, like lines of fresh players in hockey. The Gamecocks\\' bench scores 36 points per game, or nearly 45% of the team\\'s offense. Staley can go with almost any lineup, at almost any time, and know South Carolina can win. \"The simple fact is, we have great players in the starting lineup but we also have great players on the bench,\" said Fred Chmiel, a South Carolina assistant coach. \"So [Staley] doesn\\'t hesitate to sub somebody in if someone looks fatigued or they\\'re not on their best game, or they\\'re hobbled a little bit. She has no pause in just subbing in somebody and letting them play.\" Through the regular season, South Carolina starters played a combined 105 minutes a game, the fewest among the nation\\'s top 25 teams. By comparison, Iowa\\'s starters played 145 minutes. The two other Final Four teams\\' starters also played considerably more than South Carolina\\'s starters: LSU\\'s played 140 minutes, and Virginia Tech\\'s played 160 minutes. Even the Gamecocks\\' star, Boston, spent 15 of every 40 minutes a game on the bench during the regular season. Although Boston\\'s stats were better last year, when she averaged a double-double, Staley said in a news conference Tuesday, \"I think this year is the best year of her career because she\\'s able to pivot, she\\'s able to give us what we need when we need it.\" South Carolina has found its stars are willing to defer to the common good: winning its third national title in seven years. Even in an age of liberal NCAA transfer rules, the Gamecocks have had a total of just four players transfer out before finishing their undergraduate eligibility over the past five seasons, according to a team official. South Carolina\\'s core -- Boston, Zia Cooke, Brea Beal and Victaria Saxton -- has stuck around for four years. South Carolina\\'s runaway victories have given it the benefit of resting its starters. The Gamecocks are winning by an average of nearly 30 points a game. But having such a deep roster, and playing so many players double-digit minutes a game, is also a strategy. \"We have a suffocating style of defense,\" Chmiel said. \"There\\'s always a high amount of energy, intensity within that 40 minutes. It would be extremely hard for a player to play 40 minutes for us.\" Laeticia Amihere is a perfect example of the player buy-in South Carolina has achieved. The 6-foot-4 senior forward from Mississauga, Ontario, was a top-10 player out of high school. She played for Canada in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. She\\'s a projected pick in the upcoming WNBA Draft. At South Carolina she comes off the bench, averaging 7.1 points and 3.3 rebounds in 15 minutes a game. \"I just want to make it to the next level. So whatever I have to do to do that, I\\'m happy,\" Amihere said.',\n",

The bill represents Republicans\\' opening wish list as members of both parties seek a way forward on energy policy, amid concerns over high prices, climate change and overseas threats.

       "  'The Biden administration condemned the detention of a Wall Street Journal reporter in Russia for what Moscow described as espionage, the first such case of an American journalist detained for allegations of spying since the Cold War. The arrest of 31-year-old Evan Gershkovich, a Russian speaker whose parents came to the U.S. from the Soviet Union, marked the latest diplomatic flashpoint between Moscow and Washington. The two countries, already on opposite sides of a war in Ukraine , have also clashed over the arrests of each other\\'s citizens and the state of nuclear arms treaties .

       " 'Mar 30, 2023': [\"IN THE WORDS of guitarist David St. Hubbins, there's a fine line between stupid and clever. Parked squarely over the line is the 2022 GMC Hummer EV Edition 1, General Motors' all-electric off-road truck. Whatever mean tweet you could compose about GM's colossal electric sport-utility truck (SUT), I'm here for it. This 9,063-pound, 1,000-hp, six-figure spectacle of modern automaking comes equipped with everything but a sense of decency. And yet I caution against snap judgments and easy dismissals. The Hummer truck might be dumb as a hammer, but as hammers go, it's pretty ingenious. These things are still rare. Deliveries began in December 2021 but production at GM's new Factory Zero was paused in November, with a reported 5,000 produced. In the meantime GM has teed up production of the Hummer EV SUV as well as the GMC Sierra Denali EV pickup, all using the new BT1 electric skateboard and modular Ultium battery pack. I finally managed to rent an Edition 1 last week, in Florida, at the height of spring break, which might not have been my first choice. When I got to Daytona Beach, with the intention of driving on the famous strand, the streets were near-'bout roaring with young wastrels in hot cars and hitched-up pickups, or else rapping their rage-addled motorbikes from light to light. None of these delightful people seemed like they were going to sleep anytime soon. Lucky me. I had stumbled upon the Hummer's aspirational sensibility. Among these sunburned ballers and players-in-waiting, America's future super-consumers, the truck arrived like an absolute A-list star. Wow. The kids went bonkers. The mayor of Daytona Beach might as well have given me the keycard to the city. After two days in the eye of this Instagrammed hurricane—and a couple of easy stoplight victories over the fast and the curious—I started wanting to believe in GM's strategic vision for the Hummer brand, which means to advance vehicle electrification through the power of male idiocy. Consider the name, reviving a brand that embodied the most knavish sensibilities of American auto culture in the 2000s. Or observe its Soviet-style proportions: 18 feet long, 86.7 inches wide with the mirrors folded and 79.1 inches tall—with adjustable pneumatic suspension able to lift the belly of the beast another 5.8 inches, to a maximum 15.9 inches. The truck's arrival at a hotel valet stand is a daunting, prodigious moment. Guests start looking around for virgins to sacrifice. Sure, if strict reason ruled, GM's first proper electric pickup would have been smooth-skinned and aerodynamically efficient. Instead, it looks kickass and amazing! Coldly technical, chiseled and chamfered, with a mouthful of skid plate and 35-inch mudders that churn in cavernous wheel wells like machinery you don't want to fall into. Naturally, given its Borg-cube shape, the drag factors are high and, consequently, energy consumption goes from bad to terrible the faster you go. The estimated range is 329 miles. The renter reported he had gone over 400 miles by keeping below 55 mph. But at a Florida-friendly 80 mph, the real-world range looked more like 270 miles. The wind noise is so high you can barely hear the hip-hop blasting from the next vehicle. Ideally, it would be easier to see out of. As it is, the truck's high sills and squinting greenhouse create a veritable panopticon of blind spots. For that reason it is, and must be, bristling with cameras, 9 in total. Small price to pay for looking so dope. As a preview of future solutions from GM, there is lots to love. The sober and sophisticated cabin design, the material choices, the spare but modern switchgear, the smart and snappy graphical environment—the interior gets four stars. Fit and finish was excellent. Compared with the underbaked Rivian R1T I tested , the Hummer looked like it was assembled in a NASA clean room. Among the more beguiling features: four huge removable roof panels of blue-tinted glass. It's like a bro terrarium. It's certainly athletic for earth-moving equipment. Three electric motors, one between the front wheels and two between the rear, direct a combined maximum of 1,000 hp and 1,200 pound-feet to the ground. With the launch-assist engaged the truck can huck itself to 60 mph in as little as 3 seconds, according to GM. And thus something the weight of a well-equipped ambulance will accelerate like a top-line Porsche 911. Progress! I was never so premeditated. Whenever I needed to overtake, I just willed it so. Within the space of a couple inches of pedal travel, the Hummer EV will squat luridly then seem to fire itself out of its own superconducting railgun. The famous beach was closed for traffic but I found some well-groomed acreage in an out-of-the-way construction zone in which to disport. Before wading into the soft, foot-deep sand, I engaged Terrain mode, which fully liberates the rear steering system, allowing a sharper steering angle. This is the mischief mode: All you need to do is crank the wheel hard and floor it, and the truck will augur itself into a tidy circular hole in the ground. In many ways I found the Hummer truck strangely impervious to criticism. The biggest knock is its alarming 4.5-ton curb weight, nearly a third of which is battery. That is definitely not optimum. Due to the pack's mass, the truck's payload capacity is that of a midsize truck and the braking distances are like that of small civilian aircraft. It took Car and Driver 504 feet to whoa one of these down from 100 mph. But better, lighter, more compact, more energy-dense batteries are coming. Everything else about the Hummer is ready and waiting, and kind of terrific. In the meantime, stay off wooden bridges. 2022 GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 Pickup Price: $110,295 Powertrain: Fully electric, with three AC synchronous motors (one in front, two in the rear), direct drive, 205 kWh kWh liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery pack, 800V system, 11.5-kW onboard charger Power/torque: 1,000 hp/1,200 pound-feet maximum combined Length/wheelbase/width/height: 216.8/135.6/86.7/79.1 inches Curb weight: 9,063 pounds 0-60 mph: 3 seconds EPA-estimated range: 329 miles Charging: 11 kW onboard charger; DC fast charger, 20-80% in 42 mins Cargo capacity: 11.3/36.7 cubic feet, front trunk/cargo bed more in rumble seat\",\n",

Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, voted against the measure. Mr. Gonzalez said the permitting aspect of the bill is important for Democratic policies to move forward. The bill seeks to change the process of how utility-scale energy projects such as power-transmission lines and offshore wind farms are approved. Typically, the projects have to win approval from authorities in several jurisdictions , which can take years. \"While this package is far from perfect, it is a step forward,\" he said. Other Democrats have embraced permitting as a priority. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) helped push through Mr. Biden\\'s climate policy bill last year, but a companion bill he supported to speed up the permitting process stalled. While airing his frustration over that, he has also lashed out at the administration over what he says is improper implementation of the 2022 law, dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act. He is concerned that the administrations\\' interpretation of the legislation is moving the IRA away from its original intent of boosting domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains for critical minerals needed to produce electric vehicles and other products. Administration officials are \"ignoring the law\\'s intent to support and expand fossil energy and are redefining \\'domestic energy\\' to increase clean-energy spending to potentially deficit-breaking levels,\" he wrote in an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday . Mr. Manchin\\'s article was published just as the Treasury Department is set to release new rules on the sourcing of battery contents and minerals for the IRA\\'s electric-vehicle tax-credit program. \"We\\'ll see how it works out,\" Mr. Manchin said this week when asked about the GOP energy bill. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the White House will continue to work with Mr. Manchin on \"shared priorities and values\" including reducing the deficit and pursuing permitting changes. Some House Republicans have signaled a willingness to separate the legislation into parts, to see if more senators may jump on board to passing portions of the bill, such as permitting changes. \"If you can\\'t get [a project] in the ground, you can\\'t deploy those electrons on the grid from an offshore wind farm the same way as you can\\'t deploy those electrons from a coal plant in North Dakota,\" said Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R., N.D.). GOP leadership opened the legislation up to several amendments, allowing for lawmakers to amend the bill in floor votes. Several were adopted, including one by freshman Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R., Fla.) that requires the government to study the impact of wind energy on military readiness, the marine environment and tourism, before the secretary of the Interior Department can pursue development off the coast of Florida. Republicans argue that Mr. Biden\\'s policies have hampered the production of fossil fuels and driven up energy prices as a result. They say that the Biden administration shouldn\\'t look around the world to import oil and precious minerals, but instead boost production in the U.S. The Biden administration has leased fewer acres for oil-and-gas drilling offshore and on federal land in the first two years of his administration than any of his predecessors during a comparable time frame dating back to the end of World War II, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. The administration has pushed oil and fracking companies to use the permits they do have, while some companies have held off , not wanting to run out of prime locations. Some oil executives concede that investor pressure, inflation and labor and equipment shortages have done more to curtail oil production than Mr. Biden\\'s climate policies. Republicans have pointed to the Biden administration this year blocking mining upstream of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area of Northern Minnesota for 20 years, opting to protect a pristine wilderness over allowing production of minerals that could help produce clean-energy projects. The administration last year also canceled two federal mineral rights leases held by Twin Metals Minnesota LLC, a unit of Chilean mining firm Antofagasta Minerals SA. The latest move could kill the company\\'s planned underground copper-nickel mine, although Twin Metals said it would continue to fight the cancellation. The Biden administration earlier this month approved a massive Willow oil-drilling project in Alaska , over the objections of environmentalists and many Democrats. The administration also announced a plan to block future oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Ocean\\'s federal waters and issue new federal rules limiting oil and gas leasing on 13 million acres of Alaska\\'s National Petroleum Reserve.

       "  'Before the NCAA women\\'s basketball tournament began, oddsmakers said South Carolina had a 73.3% chance of winning. Not winning its first game or two, but the whole thing, meaning six in a row including the championship. Anyone who\\'s scratched out a bracket for the 68-team men\\'s or women\\'s tournaments—only to see it turn to garden mulch by Day 3—knows that odds like those aren\\'t just rare. They\\'re downright preposterous. And yet here are the No. 1 seeded Gamecocks, headed to their third consecutive Final Four and what they hope will be their second consecutive national title. On Friday they\\'ll face sharpshooting Caitlin Clark and No. 2 seed Iowa in a matchup that\\'s the hottest ticket on record: On Wednesday, tickets for the semifinals in Dallas were reselling for $272, the highest average for a Women\\'s Final Four entry since ticket marketplace Vivid Seats started tracking data in 2010. Although South Carolina has its share of stars—most notably 2022 national player of the year Aliyah Boston—Coach Dawn Staley\\'s squad is more remarkable for its colossal sturdiness. The Gamecocks are on a 42-game winning streak dating to last season. They\\'re balanced on both ends of the floor, the nation\\'s top team in rebounding and blocked shots. But where South Carolina really crushes souls is in the waves of reinforcements it can send at opponents, like lines of fresh players in hockey. The Gamecocks\\' bench scores 36 points per game, or nearly 45% of the team\\'s offense. Staley can go with almost any lineup, at almost any time, and know South Carolina can win. \"The simple fact is, we have great players in the starting lineup but we also have great players on the bench,\" said Fred Chmiel, a South Carolina assistant coach. \"So [Staley] doesn\\'t hesitate to sub somebody in if someone looks fatigued or they\\'re not on their best game, or they\\'re hobbled a little bit. She has no pause in just subbing in somebody and letting them play.\" Through the regular season, South Carolina starters played a combined 105 minutes a game, the fewest among the nation\\'s top 25 teams. By comparison, Iowa\\'s starters played 145 minutes. The two other Final Four teams\\' starters also played considerably more than South Carolina\\'s starters: LSU\\'s played 140 minutes, and Virginia Tech\\'s played 160 minutes. Even the Gamecocks\\' star, Boston, spent 15 of every 40 minutes a game on the bench during the regular season. Although Boston\\'s stats were better last year, when she averaged a double-double, Staley said in a press conference Tuesday, \"I think this year is the best year of her career because she\\'s able to pivot, she\\'s able to give us what we need when we need it.\" South Carolina has found its stars are willing to defer to the common good: winning its third national title in seven years. Even in an age of liberal NCAA transfer rules, the Gamecocks have had a total of just four players transfer out before finishing their undergraduate eligibility over the past five seasons, according to a team official. South Carolina\\'s core—Boston, Zia Cooke, Brea Beal and Victaria Saxton—has stuck around for four years. Certainly, South Carolina\\'s runaway victories have given it the benefit of resting its starters. The Gamecocks are winning by an average of nearly 30 points a game. But having such a deep roster, and playing so many players double-digit minutes a game, is also a strategy. \"We have a suffocating style of defense,\" Chmiel said. \"And then offensively, we push to score on makes and misses. So we\\'re always running the floor. There\\'s always a high amount of energy, intensity within that 40 minutes. It would be extremely hard for a player to play 40 minutes for us.\" Chmiel acknowledged that competing programs use South Carolina\\'s depth against it in recruiting, telling top players won\\'t see the court much there. He counters that by pointing to Boston\\'s playing time—and her achievements. \"She\\'s still All-American,\" he said. \"She\\'s still been player of the year, defensive player of the year, all-conference. She plays 25 minutes. That allows somebody else to get 15 minutes on the average. So if you\\'re a freshman coming in, you know you\\'re not going to sit there and watch an entire game, that there\\'s 15 minutes available to play.\" Laeticia Amihere is a perfect example of the player buy-in South Carolina has achieved. The 6-foot-4 senior forward from Mississauga, Ontario, was a top-10 player out of high school. She played for Canada in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. She\\'s a projected pick in the upcoming WNBA Draft. At South Carolina she comes off the bench, averaging 7.1 points and 3.3 rebounds in 15 minutes a game. \"I think we\\'ve just been kind of lucky in that way where we\\'re able to push a lead and we\\'re able to play, like, our third string and still be able to excel,\" Amihere said. \"Obviously I just want to make it to the next level. So whatever I have to do to do that, I\\'m happy.\" There, again, South Carolina turns less playing time into a selling point. \"AAU basketball goes the majority of the year before they get here,\" Chmiel said. \"They get no breaks. It goes right into scholastic basketball. They get no breaks. So I mean, they\\'re playing four straight years and then they\\'re going to come here and log 32 games, so 120 more games. That\\'s a lot of minutes.\" If seniors are good enough, they\\'ll go directly into the WNBA season, then probably play for an overseas team in the offseason. \"So we embrace the fact that we can sit them down and rest them,\" Chmiel said. That luxury has given South Carolina another advantage: one of the best-rested teams at the Final Four.',\n",
       "  'Coal prices have come crashing down from last year\\'s records. Central Appalachian coal has been trading at $88.80 a short ton, down 57% from the record $205.55 at the start of the year. Cash prices for thermal coal mined from northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin—two places where a lot of exported coal originates—have fallen more than half since September, when Europe was stocking up for winter . Futures for coal that is shipped around the Pacific from an Australian export facility have made a similar plunge. Coal markets are highly influenced by those for natural gas , which is also burned to generate electricity. As with coal, natural-gas inventories that looked alarmingly low last summer recovered thanks to unusually warm winter weather that obviated a lot of demand for heating. Natural-gas futures for May delivery ended Thursday at $2.104 per million British thermal unit, down 63% from a year ago. Even after the decline in coal prices, varieties produced in the eastern U.S. have lately cost between $3.10 to $3.55 per million BTUs, according to the Energy Information Administration. That suggests that coal prices might have to fall further to regain competitiveness with natural gas. Coal also faces increased competition from renewables , including wind, solar, hydropower and biomass, which last year accounted for more U.S. power generation than coal for the first time ever , federal record-keepers say. Coal remains expensive relative to prepandemic prices, but its rapid deflation shows that power producers around the world are confident enough in their supplies to stop bidding up cargoes. \"We went from undersupplied to oversupplied very quickly,\" said Andy Blumenfeld, data analytics director at McCloskey by OPIS, a pricing service that is part of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co. Prices started surging in 2021, when power producers fired up coal-burning generators to keep air conditioners running during some of the hottest temperatures on record. Stockpiles at U.S. power plants shrank to their lowest level since the Nixon administration . A ban on Russian exports following the invasion of Ukraine further crimped supplies while the highest natural-gas prices in years and the prospect of shortages pushed up what power generators were willing to pay for coal. By the summer of 2022— another scorcher —power producers on both sides of the Atlantic were competing for a limited supply of unsold coal. North American power generators\\' stockpiles dwindled to as little as 58 days\\' worth of coal, nearly a month less than the five-year average, according to energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. Congestion at ports and along rail lines ensnared cargoes, prompting grid operators and utilities to take unusual steps to curtail coal use before the weather turned cold. In Colorado, Xcel Energy Inc.\\'s state subsidiary dialed back how much coal it burned in favor of natural gas, even as the competing fuel\\'s price spiked to shale-era highs. \"Given the fact that we were seeing delays and shortages in the delivery of coal, we made the prudent call that we would use less coal so that we could conserve that in advance of the winter heating season,\" said Robert Kenney, president of Xcel Energy\\'s Colorado arm. Warm winter weather left a lot of coal unburned, though. Between December and January U.S. inventories grew by 4.6% at a time of year when they typically decline, according to EIA data. As they raced to stock up, utilities ordered all the coal they could, much of which is scheduled to be delivered this year and could create a glut, analysts say. For decades coal was the primary fuel burned to generate electricity in the U.S. Since 2010, though, U.S. coal-fired generating capacity has dropped more than 36% amid concerns about emissions and the abundance of gas unleashed by the shale-drilling boom , according to FactSet. Power plant owners are expected to retire another 4.5% of coal-fired capacity this year, according to the EIA. As coal-burning capacity has dwindled, so has financing for speculative production. Miners now sell most of their output in advance, with not much more to sell if demand is greater than expected. Big mining companies have told investors that they are mostly sold out for 2023. It is possible that power producers have overbought and will try to resell their coal in export markets or renegotiate deals with their suppliers, which could add downward pressure to prices, McCloskey\\'s Mr. Blumenfeld said. Already, he said, some utilities are burning coal to make space for incoming deliveries even though it has become uneconomical.',\n",
       "  'WASHINGTON -- President Biden said he needs to see House Republicans\\' budget proposal to start negotiations related to raising the nation\\'s borrowing limit. House Republicans\\' response: not going to happen. The chairman of the House Budget Committee, Texas Rep. Jodey Arrington, said in an interview that the GOP budget process could take months to play out, pushing it past the deadline for Congress to act on raising the debt ceiling and avoid a U.S. default on debt payments and other government obligations. Instead, he and other top Republicans want to start talks immediately on a shorter list of demands for this year, without a formal budget in hand. \"The more urgent matter is to address the debt ceiling and negotiate spending limitations and broader fiscal reforms in the process,\" Mr. Arrington said. On when Republicans could produce a budget, the Texas lawmaker said he would be disappointed if the House didn\\'t pass a budget resolution before the end of the fiscal year in September. GOP lawmakers want spending reductions and policy changes as a condition for raising the debt limit. Mr. Biden has said the debt ceiling should be raised with no conditions attached, while saying he is open to a separate debate over fiscal policy once Republicans produce a budget. The Treasury Department ran up against the roughly $31.4 trillion debt limit in January. It is now deploying special accounting maneuvers to keep paying the government\\'s obligations. The U.S. could become unable to pay all of its bills as soon as this summer. Mr. Arrington pointed to a list of priorities presented by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) as the opening bid for Republicans in their negotiations with the White House. The list, referenced in a letter Mr. McCarthy sent Tuesday to Mr. Biden, includes rolling back top-line spending to fiscal 2022 levels and locking in small annual increases from there, as well as clawing back unspent Covid-19 funds, strengthening work requirements for government programs and making changes to energy policy. In his letter, Mr. McCarthy said that talks should begin immediately. The White House released its own budget proposal earlier this month, which includes tax increases designed to narrow the budget deficit. Mr. Biden said Tuesday that he wanted to see Mr. McCarthy\\'s budget plan before Easter recess -- which starts Friday -- before beginning talks. While neither budget would have a chance of becoming law, they serve to outline the parties\\' policy intentions. Under the law, Congress is supposed to release a budget resolution in April, though lawmakers from both parties have failed to meet that deadline in recent years. Mr. McCarthy had previously said the GOP budget would be delayed a short time because the president\\'s own budget was late. Republicans have set a goal of balancing the budget over 10 years while extending expiring tax cuts, an effort that would require deep reductions across the government, particularly if Social Security, Medicare and defense are off the table, as lawmakers have indicated. Mr. Arrington said the broader overhaul of federal taxes and spending would have to wait until later this year, because of its complexities as well as the need to build GOP consensus in the closely divided House. Delaying a fuller budget, he said, would also put off anticipated political attacks that could derail talks over the debt ceiling with Mr. Biden. He said he didn\\'t plan to address the solvency of Social Security and Medicare in his budget, saying instead that entitlement spending should be tackled in a bipartisan manner through separate discussions. The White House has said that the GOP budget effort would lay out severe cuts to federal spending, making the proposal politically radioactive for many Republican lawmakers facing re-election next year. \"Every week, House Republicans invent a new excuse to hide their budget from the American people even while signaling that they would impose devastating cuts,\" said White House spokesman Andrew Bates. --- Lindsay Wise contributed to this article.',\n",
       "  'The Biden administration is pushing hard for American businesses to invest in Africa despite the obstacles they face there, more than a decade after China began expanding its economic and political ties with countries across the continent. Vice President Kamala Harris pledged on Tuesday in Ghana\\'s seaside capital to double down on efforts to bring billions of dollars in investments to Africa, a continent many Western investors still view as high risk. Ms. Harris is the highest ranking in a string of top White House and Biden administration officials to travel through Africa this year, promising to unlock American investment as the U.S. and China look to tap into the continent\\'s vast natural resources. But U.S. and other Western investors often cite corruption, poor infrastructure and still-rampant poverty, all of which preclude easily operating across dozens of countries that all have their own rules and market peculiarities. U.S. interest in expanding influence on the continent comes as tensions and competition with China are rising. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, Chinese companies have spent over a decade and billions of dollars buying out U.S. and European miners in the country\\'s cobalt and copper belt. Experts say the U.S. has a lot of ground to make up, especially in areas of strategic importance, like securing supply chains for materials such as battery metals, critical for the energy transition. \"The Chinese system is a lot more centralized, and state power plays a much larger role,\" said Cobus van Staden, Johannesburg-based managing editor of the China-Global South Project, formerly known as the China Africa Project, a nonprofit. \"The Chinese view on Africa has been very opportunity focused. There is this very strong focus on risk in the U.S. private sector, to the exclusion of all of the opportunities.\" The U.S. financed roughly $14 billion of projects on the continent from 2007 to 2020, while comparable Chinese institutions financed about $120 billion over the period, according to an analysis by Oyintarelado Moses, a data analyst with the Global China Initiative at Boston University\\'s Global Development Policy Center, using data from the U.S. government and the Chinese Loans to Africa Database. Ms. Harris\\'s trip follows visits to Africa by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield this year, but U.S. officials still face institutional hurdles to counter Chinese economic dominance on the continent. \"In terms of perception, I think [the U.S. is] doing everything right,\" said Gyude Moore, senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development and Liberia\\'s former Minister of Public Works. The stumbling blocks that remain include a lack of available infrastructure financing from the U.S., easier access to higher education in China for Africans versus the U.S., and concerns that this U.S. push into Africa might be episodic, he said. On Wednesday, Ms. Harris announced about $1 billion of new programs and investments aimed at empowering African businesswomen -- much of it from foundations.',\n",
       "  'DUBAI -- Saudi Arabia is strengthening its commercial and security ties with China, as U.S. influence wanes in the Middle East. The Saudi government approved partial membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a political and security bloc that includes China, Russia and India, the Saudi state news agency reported Wednesday. The decision comes ahead of a May meeting of foreign ministers from the regional grouping, where Iran recently gained full member status. The move is part of a broad effort in Saudi Arabia and some neighboring Persian Gulf countries to expand diplomatic partnerships beyond traditional Western allies in a marked pivot to the east, analysts say. It comes amid uncertainty about Washington\\'s long-term commitment to ensure security in the strategic, energy-rich region, where the U.S. has been a dominant force for decades but is increasingly focused on a rising China and a belligerent Russia. In a sign of the geopolitical realignment under way, Saudi Arabia re-established diplomatic relations with rival Iran this month in a deal brokered by China that burnished Beijing\\'s credentials as a new power broker in the region. The Saudi kingdom also is nearing a deal to restore ties with Syria following negotiations mediated by Russia. The SCO historically has had a heavy focus on regional security cooperation, and accelerated Saudi interactions with China and Russia there risk backlash from the U.S., which is wary of its traditional security partners in the region cozying up to its global rivals. \"By engaging with these U.S. rivals, it really does seem like this multipolarity is in full-bore here now,\" said Jonathan Fulton, an expert on China-Middle East relations and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. \"We\\'re seeing what a less U.S.-centered Gulf or Middle East looks like.\" Analysts say China isn\\'t trying to replace the broad American role in the Middle East, where the U.S.\\'s continued military presence is unrivaled, but could chip away at its supremacy in the region. Saudi Arabia and China are building on ties that, until now, were firmly rooted in energy and trade, as Beijing\\'s oil imports swelled in the past three decades in line with its expanding economy. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\\'s de facto ruler, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Tuesday, reaffirming their strategic relationship which Mr. Xi said was in \"the best shape of all time,\" Chinese state media said. China is Saudi Arabia\\'s top trading partner. Besides oil, business has expanded to include large contracts for Chinese construction companies, widespread adoption of Chinese technology despite security concerns and the transfer of military hardware. China is also helping the Saudis fabricate uranium yellowcake, which is needed for a nuclear-energy program or nuclear-arms capability. Earlier this week, the two countries signed major deals that saw state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco take a $3.6 billion stake in Rongsheng Petrochemical Co. Ltd. to expand its downstream presence in China and join with Norinco Group and Panjin Xincheng Industrial Group to construct an integrated refinery and petrochemical complex in northeast China. The refinery and petrochemical complex is expected to produce 300,000 barrels a day at a cost of 83.7 billion yuan, or $12.2 billion. The announcements coincide with Russia overtaking Saudi Arabia as China\\'s main oil supplier in the first two months of 2023.'],\n",

He said he didn\\'t plan to address the solvency of Social Security and Medicare in his budget, saying instead that entitlement spending should be tackled in a bipartisan manner through separate discussions. As much as 92% of projected nominal spending growth is driven by Social Security, federal healthcare programs and interest payments on the national debt, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Trustees for the Social Security Trust Funds projected last year that the program\\'s combined reserves would be depleted in 2035 . Once Social Security\\'s reserves run out, revenue would pay for roughly 80% of scheduled benefits, unless Congress steps in. The White House has said that the GOP budget effort would lay out severe cuts to federal spending, making the proposal politically radioactive for many Republican lawmakers facing re-election next year. \"Every week, House Republicans invent a new excuse to hide their budget from the American people even while signaling that they would impose devastating cuts,\" said White House spokesman Andrew Bates. A recent Congressional Budget Office analysis showed how difficult balancing the budget will be. Under a scenario in which Medicare and Social Security as well as military and veterans spending are protected, and expiring tax cuts are extended, even eliminating 100% of all other noninterest federal spending would still result in a small deficit. Mr. Arrington said that the eventual GOP proposal would make significant progress in closing the deficit but might not hit the goal of balancing the budget in a decade, based on trade-offs needed to get enough GOP votes to pass the package. He compared the effort to herding butterflies, calling his colleagues \"lively, colorful and unwieldy.\" On balancing the budget, he said, \"whether it\\'s 10 years, whether it\\'s 10 or 12, or 15…you will know the direction and the policies that drive our directional difference between the president and our Republican budget,\" he said.

       "  'BERLIN—Britain\\'s King Charles III is visiting Germany this week on his first official foreign trip since ascending to the throne , part of the British government\\'s wider charm offensive with its European neighbors to move past years of feuding caused by Brexit and bolster Western support for Ukraine. The British government has deployed the new king in a soft-power play that aims to reinforce cultural bonds between the two nations and point to how they can work more closely together on issues such as climate change and foreign policy, British officials said. The king was also due to visit France last week, but that trip was abandoned at the behest of the French government amid mass protests in the country over a pension overhaul. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who unlike his French and U.S. counterparts holds a largely ceremonial role, welcomed King Charles and Camilla, the queen consort, at the historic Brandenburg Gate on Wednesday with military honors. He is set to host a state banquet for the monarch in the evening. Buckingham Palace said it was the first time that a head of state was welcomed at the gate. U.S. President Ronald Reagan held a speech with the gate in the background in 1987, but this was before Germany\\'s reunification, when the triumphal arch stood on the East side of the Berlin Wall. \"Today, on the day six years ago when Britain began its exit from the European Union, we are opening a new chapter,\" Mr. Steinmeier said in a speech later Wednesday. He said that the king\\'s choice to visit Germany for his inaugural foreign trip as monarch was a \"great personal gesture and I think at the same time an important sign for German-British relations.\" Earlier, the monarch and the queen consort posted on Twitter about their \"great joy to be able to continue the deepening of the longstanding friendship between our two nations.\" On Thursday, the monarch is set to give a speech at Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, which he addressed in 2020 as the then-prince of Wales. He will also meet Chancellor Olaf Scholz, talk to Ukrainian refugees and meet with British and German soldiers. In recent months, Britain has sought to refresh ties with its European neighbors after years of acrimony following its split from the European Union. Most recently, the U.K. announced a compromise deal with the EU to end a long-running argument over trading arrangements with Northern Ireland. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak visited Paris earlier this month to heap praise on French President Emmanuel Macron . The king\\'s tour to France and Germany was set to seal this rapprochement. Buckingham Palace says that the trip not only serves to reinforce relations but also to point to how the two nations can work together to tackle climate change, support Ukraine in its war with Russia and improve trading relations, which have been damaged by Brexit. King Charles, who is of German descent, is no stranger to Germany. In his previous role as Prince of Wales, he undertook 29 visits to the country. The royal couple will travel to the northern city of Hamburg on Friday, where they will visit a memorial of one of its main churches, which was bombed by British and American forces during World War II. While in Germany, the king, who is known for his environmental agenda, will also visit an organic farm and discuss green energy. In Germany, interest in the visit hasn\\'t matched that sparked by previous trips by Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles\\'s mother, with most large newspapers giving it only cursory treatment ahead of the trip.

The SCO has historically had a heavy focus on regional security cooperation, and accelerated Saudi interactions with China and Russia there risk backlash from the U.S., which is wary of its traditional security partners in the region cozying up to its global rivals. \"By engaging with these U.S. rivals, it really does seem like this multipolarity is in full-bore here now,\" said Jonathan Fulton, an expert on China-Middle East relations and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. \"We\\'re seeing what a less U.S.-centered Gulf or Middle East looks like.\" Analysts say China isn\\'t trying to replace the broad American role in the Middle East, where the U.S.\\'s continued military presence is unrivaled, but could chip away at its supremacy in the region. Saudi Arabia and China are building on ties that, until now, were firmly rooted in energy and trade, as Beijing\\'s oil imports swelled over the last three decades in line with its expanding economy. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\\'s de facto ruler, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Tuesday, reaffirming their strategic relationship which Mr. Xi said was in \"the best shape of all time,\" according to Chinese state media. China is Saudi Arabia\\'s top trading partner. Besides oil, business has expanded to include large contracts for Chinese construction companies, widespread adoption of Chinese technology despite security concerns and the transfer of military hardware such as drones and ballistic missiles. China is also helping the Saudis fabricate uranium yellowcake, which is needed for a nuclear-energy program or nuclear-arms capability. Earlier this week, the two countries signed major deals that saw state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco take a $3.6 billion stake in Rongsheng Petrochemical Co. Ltd. to expand its downstream presence in China and join with Norinco Group and Panjin Xincheng Industrial Group to construct an integrated refinery and petrochemical complex in northeast China. The refinery and petrochemical complex is expected to produce 300,000 barrels a day at a cost of 83.7 billion yuan, equivalent to $12.2 billion. The deal was first agreed during a visit by Prince Mohammed to Beijing in 2019. Earlier in March, Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser said the company, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., was continuing to give priority to downstream assets in large markets such as China. \"We think China will continue to grow in terms of demand,\" Mr. Nasser said. \"We have a number of investments, but we cannot declare right now, but hopefully in the next one to two years, even through 2023, we are going to have a number of investments in China. The announcements by Aramco coincide with Russia overtaking Saudi Arabia as China\\'s main oil supplier in the first two months of 2023. Saudi Arabia was China\\'s top crude supplier in 2022, selling 1.75 million barrels a day, according to data from China\\'s General Administration of Customs. Aramco had previously considered selling shares on a global exchange but eventually floated shares on its local exchange in 2019 for a $29.4 billion listing that was the world\\'s largest-ever initial public offering . Hong Kong officials are now vying for a second chance at winning a secondary listing, which would be a boon for the city. By listing there, Aramco could tap demand from investors in mainland China.',\n",
       "  'The Biden administration is pushing hard for American businesses to invest in Africa despite the obstacles they face there, more than a decade after China began expanding its economic and political ties with countries across the continent. Vice President Kamala Harris pledged Tuesday in Ghana\\'s seaside capital to \"double down\" on efforts to bring billions of dollars in investments to Africa, a continent that many Western investors still view as high risk . Ms. Harris is the highest ranking in a string of top White House and Biden administration officials to travel through Africa this year, promising to unlock American investment as both the U.S. and China look to tap into the continent\\'s vast natural resources. But U.S. and other Western investors often cite corruption, poor infrastructure and still rampant poverty, all of which preclude easily operating across dozens of countries that all have their own rules and market peculiarities. U.S. interest in expanding influence on the continent comes as tensions and competition with China are rising. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, Chinese companies have spent over a decade and billions of dollars buying out U.S. and European miners in the country\\'s cobalt and copper belt. Experts say the U.S. has a lot of ground to make up, especially in areas of strategic importance, like securing supply chains for materials such as battery metals, critical for the energy transition. \"The Chinese system is a lot more centralized, and state power plays a much larger role,\" said Cobus van Staden, Johannesburg-based managing editor of the China-Global South Project, formerly known as The China Africa Project, a nonprofit. \"The Chinese view on Africa has been very opportunity focused. There is this very strong focus on risk in the U.S. private sector, to the exclusion of all of the opportunities.\" The U.S. financed roughly $14 billion worth of projects on the continent from 2007 to 2020, while comparable Chinese institutions financed about $120 billion over the same period of time, according to an analysis by Oyintarelado Moses, a data analyst with the Global China Initiative at Boston University\\'s Global Development Policy Center, using data from the U.S. government and the Chinese Loans to Africa Database. Ms. Harris\\'s trip follows visits to various African nations by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield this year, but U.S. officials still face deeply-entrenched institutional hurdles to counter Chinese economic dominance on the continent. \"In terms of perception, I think [the U.S. is] doing everything right,\" said Gyude Moore, senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development and Liberia\\'s former Minister of Public Works. The stumbling blocks that remain include a lack of available infrastructure financing from the U.S., easier access to higher education in China for Africans versus the U.S., and concerns that this U.S. push into Africa might be episodic, he said. \"There\\'s a lingering threat that a change in administration will return Africa to the cold again,\" Mr. Moore said. On Wednesday Ms. Harris appeared at the Mix Design Hub, a stylish, four-story office space and gallery in Accra\\'s trendy Osu neighborhood, and announced about $1 billion of new programs and investments on the continent aimed at empowering African business women —much of it from foundations. They include nearly $500 million to provide African women more access to technology, and she said that the U.S. will join with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to launch a new fund to help close the so-called gender digital divide. Other new funds include $500 million from the Nigeria-based Tony Elumelu Foundation, with a large chunk earmarked specifically to support female entrepreneurs. \"There\\'s a direct correlation between policies that are directed at the economic empowerment of women and the general prosperity of societies,\" Ms. Harris said Wednesday morning surrounded by women business-owners. But structural problems persist for U.S. companies that want to expand operations on the continent. Bobby Pittman, the founder of Kupanda Capital and an investor in Mavin Records, a leading record label on the continent, said that U.S. public lending institutions are seen as slower and more bureaucratic than their Chinese counterparts. With China, he said, \"all the financing comes with one signature,\" while the U.S. can take months to help companies finance large-scale projects on the continent. Others say the tide is shifting as demand in some sectors increases. Rob Still, a partner at Denham Capital Management LP, a U.S.-based global energy transition investment firm, said projects for commodities such as cobalt, niobium, lithium and tin would previously have been turned down immediately by more risk-averse Western development agencies because those commodities can\\'t be hedged through an exchange on a futures market—either because the market is too thin or doesn\\'t exist. Now, that is no longer the case. \"There\\'s definitely more interest and action than there has been in the past,\" especially from the Americans, said Mr. Still, who is based in Johannesburg. On the second day of President Biden\\'s summit with African leaders in Washington, D.C., in December, the U.S. government announced that KoBold Metals, a commercial startup backed by Bill Gates\\'s Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which aims to use artificial intelligence to find metals needed for the electric-vehicle boom, agreed to invest $150 million to buy a controlling stake in a large, undeveloped copper deposit in Zambia. The deal is part of the U.S. government\\'s new push into critical minerals in Africa. \"We sought out the U.S. government generally for support on our activities in Zambia,\" said Josh Goldman, KoBold\\'s president. \"We just want a smooth path for deploying lots of capital.\" Zambia\\'s president sees the investment as a sign of bigger things to come: \"It is important. When one investment comes, you are likely to get a second one,\" Hakainde Hichilema told The Wall Street Journal. U.S. officials have also highlighted that Chinese financing often comes with strings attached, such as using Chinese companies and Chinese-made materials. Ms. Harris alluded to the complications of taking money from Beijing during a news conference at the Ghanaian presidential palace Monday, referencing a need to \"ease the debt burden that is facing far too many countries,\" without mentioning China by name. Chinese lenders account for 12% of Africa\\'s private and public external debt, according to a December 2022 Chatham House report. Ghana and Zambia, two countries that Ms. Harris is visiting, are both currently looking to Beijing for relief. \"We are concerned with what is happening on the globe as a whole, we are clear-eyed about that,\" Ms. Harris said when asked Monday in Accra about how much the rise of China figures into her trip. \"But this trip is motivated by the importance of the direct relationship between the United States and Ghana, and as I travel the continent, those countries.\" Gabriele Steinhauser contributed to this article.',\n",
       "  'YouTube\\'s chief executive said in an email that the company is looking into a claim by Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi that the Alphabet Inc. unit is suppressing his videos criticizing India\\'s ruling party and a billionaire who controls a conglomerate accused of wide-ranging fraud . The March 25 email from YouTube\\'s Neal Mohan, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, came in response to a letter sent two weeks earlier from the leader of a group of overseas Indians who support Mr. Gandhi\\'s Congress party. The letter, which was reviewed by the Journal, included data from Mr. Gandhi\\'s social-media team making the case that his videos related to \"the issue of cronyism of the ruling government with one industrialist, Mr. Gautam Adani,\" are receiving views that are significantly lower than YouTube analytics suggest they should be, and are being \"suppressed, perhaps unwittingly and algorithmically.\" The data, which was reviewed by the Journal, showed that based on interactions such as likes on two videos alleging Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given special treatment to the company headed by Mr. Adani, the Adani Group, the videos should have received about 2.8 million views combined, but instead got less than a third of that. The data also suggested Mr. Gandhi\\'s videos are receiving fewer views because they are now recommended less frequently to users via YouTube\\'s home page, the letter said. \"Thanks,\" Mr. Mohan wrote in reply. \"Team is taking a look,\" he wrote, without elaborating. Representatives for Alphabet Inc.\\'s Google and YouTube didn\\'t respond to requests for comment. Representatives for the Prime Minister\\'s Office, Mr. Modi\\'s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the Adani Group didn\\'t immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Gandhi and other opposition parties have been pressing Mr. Modi\\'s government to investigate allegations of stock-price manipulation and fraud involving the Adani Group, which had worked closely with the government in modernizing airports, ports and other infrastructure. U.S. short seller Hindenburg Research in January accused the energy and infrastructure conglomerate of improprieties such as using shell companies to manipulate its share prices. The Adani Group has denied the allegations . Google, like other U.S. tech titans, has been in New Delhi\\'s crosshairs in recent years as Mr. Modi\\'s government has tightened rules on foreign e-commerce players and moved to tamp down online dissent on platforms such as Twitter Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc.\\'s Facebook. Google in January lost an appeal in India\\'s Supreme Court to block an antitrust order that requires it to make significant changes to the way its Android operating system does business with smartphone makers, app developers and users. Mr. Mohan, previously YouTube\\'s chief product officer, became head of YouTube in February after longtime chief executive Susan Wojcicki stepped down. Mr. Gandhi in 2021 wrote to Twitter Inc.\\'s chief executive alleging he was the victim of a government campaign to limit his ability to attract new followers on the platform. His account then began gaining new followers at a rapid clip. India\\'s Parliament on Friday disqualified Mr. Gandhi as a lawmaker after a lower court convicted and sentenced him to two years in prison in a defamation case over remarks he made in a 2019 campaign speech referring to \"thieves\" as having the surname Modi. Mr. Gandhi\\'s Congress party plans to appeal the conviction soon, according to party leaders. If the appeal is accepted, Mr. Gandhi would be able to retake his seat in the legislature.',\n",
       "  'WASHINGTON -- Republicans and Democrats are sparring over measures in the $53 billion Chips Act that the Biden administration says are needed to ensure the measure\\'s success, but which Republicans say are an effort to pursue liberal social policies. The Commerce Department has set rules for semiconductor companies seeking grants under the act that encourage the hiring of union workforces and economically disadvantaged individuals. Companies seeking more than $150 million must provide child care. A group of Republican senators including Ted Cruz of Texas and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee recently wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo saying the measures will make \"domestic chip production more expensive, less competitive, and reliant on taxpayer subsidies over private investment.\" In an interview, Ms. Raimondo pushed back on those claims. She said measures such as requiring chip makers to pay prevailing wages and provide child care are necessary to address a workforce shortage that could hinder efforts to expand semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. \"There is zero \\'social policy\\' that we\\'re trying to achieve here,\" Ms. Raimondo said. She added that the success of the Chips Act largely hinges on overcoming a labor shortage that could imperil plans to compete with China. \"We want them to show us a workforce plan, including how they think about child care, not because we have a social agenda but because we know [that] they\\'re struggling to hire workers,\" Ms. Raimondo said. Ms. Raimondo joined President Biden in North Carolina on Tuesday for a visit to a semiconductor manufacturer in Durham that has plans to build a $5 billion chip-manufacturing plant projected to create 1,800 new jobs. During the visit, Mr. Biden said more than $435 billion in private sector manufacturing commitments have been made since he took office. A White House official said those investments would span at least the next decade and include more than $200 billion in clean energy, electric vehicle and battery investments, over $200 billion in semiconductors, and about $15 billion in biomanufacturing investments. Mr. Biden said the U.S. is \"determined to lead the world in the manufacturing of semiconductors.\" He also aimed at Republicans who have proposed cuts to government spending, saying doing so would cede \"the future of innovation and technology to China.\" In their letter, dated March 22, 14 Republican senators said that many of the rules the Biden administration has imposed on chip subsidy applicants weren\\'t specified in the Chips Act. Their criticism echoed prior complaints from Republicans that conditions for companies applying for semiconductor funding are being used \"to pursue controversial policies that go beyond the requirements of the law.\"',\n",
       "  'WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Kevin McCarthy tried to prod President Biden into starting talks over spending cuts as a condition for raising the debt ceiling, just as Republicans are struggling to unite around a blueprint for negotiations ahead of dual deadlines later this year. The White House released its own budget proposal earlier this month and has said it won\\'t negotiate on spending until Republicans put forward their own plan. Mr. McCarthy has rejected that notion and said in a letter to Mr. Biden that talks should start as soon as possible. \"The budget has nothing to do with the debt ceiling,\" Mr. McCarthy told reporters. In his letter to Mr. Biden on Tuesday morning, the California Republican reiterated that he wanted to roll back nondefense discretionary spending and lock in low annual increases from there, while also proposing clawing back unspent Covid-19 relief funds and strengthening work requirements for social programs. He also called for measures to lower energy costs and secure the border, two priorities for House Republicans. The White House dismissed the letter, calling again for the House to pass a debt-ceiling increase with no spending cuts attached -- leaving any talks at an impasse. Mr. Biden has said the debt limit needed to be raised without conditions but has said he would engage in discussions over taxes and spending once Mr. McCarthy produces his budget plan. Many lawmakers expect the GOP budget to be completed in May or later. Mr. Biden responded in his own letter late Tuesday, telling Mr. McCarthy he looked forward to \"talking about our nation\\'s economic and fiscal future\" separate from the debt ceiling. \"But for that conversation to be productive, we should both tell the American people what we are for,\" he said. The Treasury Department ran up against the roughly $31.4 trillion debt limit in January. It is now deploying a series of special accounting maneuvers to keep paying the government\\'s obligations to bondholders, Social Security recipients and others. The U.S. could become unable to pay all of its bills as soon as this summer.

The event kicked off a three-week tour that will see Mr. Biden and other top administration officials visit key battleground states to tout legislative accomplishments as the president gears up for a likely re-election campaign where the impact of his domestic economic policies is expected to be a core theme. Mr. Biden said the U.S. is \"determined to lead the world in the manufacturing of semiconductors.\" He also took aim at Republicans who have proposed cuts to government spending, arguing that doing so \"would mean ceding the future of innovation and technology to China.\" He added, \"We\\'re not going to let them undo all the progress we made.\" Mr. Biden\\'s approval rating neared the lowest point of his presidency in a new poll while another recent survey found most Americans think the president has accomplished \"not very much\" or \"little or nothing\" during his tenure. Mr. Biden and his administration are now ramping up efforts to sell the impact of its policies as the president begins making the case for a second term, although he has yet to formally launch his re-election campaign. In their letter, dated March 22, the 14 Republican senators said that many of the rules the Biden administration has imposed on chip subsidy applicants weren\\'t specified in the Chips Act. Their criticism echoed prior complaints from Republicans that conditions for companies applying for the first round of semiconductor funding are being used \"as a tool to pursue controversial policies that go beyond the requirements of the law.\" This includes sharing profit that exceed projections with the government and favoring applicants who commit to pursuing \"environmental justice\" measures. The Republicans said the Commerce Department\\'s criteria will add to companies\\' costs for building facilities and making the U.S. less competitive against other manufacturing nations. Ms. Raimondo said preferences added by the department on child care and workforce development are aimed at speeding up the launch of the projects amid the shortage of workers. She said that the department will take a holistic approach and negotiate terms of the agreement flexibly with individual companies as it applies the criteria stated in the application materials. She added that the department\\'s primary goal is to get the projects up and running quickly and efficiently, and that the request to submit plans is to make sure the projects are built on time and on budget and staffed effectively. \"The way you\\'re going to meet your workforce needs in rural Idaho is different than in Texas or New York,\" she said. \"We\\'re not going to predetermine the way they fulfill these projects.\" The Chips Act passed Congress with bipartisan support last year, marking another bipartisan achievement for Mr. Biden after the passage of the $1 trillion infrastructure law in November 2021. In the Senate, 17 Republicans joined a nearly unanimous Democratic caucus in favor of the bill, while two dozen Republicans crossed party lines to help pass it in the House. Ms. Raimondo lobbied both Democrats and Republicans amid negotiations around the legislation, with an emphasis on the national-security concerns of continuing to rely on Taiwan or U.S. adversaries for semiconductors. Companies building leading-edge chip factories in the U.S. can begin applying for the Chips Act funds Friday. The application process for companies looking to build current generation and mature technology facilities opens June 26.',\n",
       "  'The U.S. and China have described Taiwan as the most volatile flashpoint in their increasingly fraught bilateral relations. Now, after months of sparring by Washington and Beijing over the Ukraine war, a suspected surveillance balloon , TikTok and other issues, Taiwan is set to return to the center of great power tensions, with the island\\'s leader traveling to the U.S. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen is stopping in New York and Los Angeles on her way to and from Central America, with plans to meet House Speaker Kevin McCarthy next week in California. Some in the Biden administration are concerned that the visit will give Beijing the pretext to conduct military exercises near the island , as it did last summer, or erode Taiwan\\'s security in other ways, according to officials. As Ms. Tsai\\'s arrival in New York on Wednesday approaches, U.S. officials have been sounding out Ms. Tsai\\'s government to ensure her trip stays within past norms, while also urging Beijing against reacting strongly , the officials and people familiar with the talks said. Visits by Taiwanese presidents to the U.S. are always carefully managed affairs, with Washington trying to give the island\\'s leaders a way to show that their government has U.S. support, without giving Beijing an opening for forceful retaliation. How the three governments handle the visit is likely to determine whether Washington- Beijing relations deteriorate further. All three are readying their militaries for a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is a longstanding U.S. partner that Beijing regards as its territory, and domestic politics make compromise difficult for each. \"There is a possibility that the transit, if not carefully handled, could blow up in everybody\\'s face,\" said Bonnie Glaser, who heads the Indo-Pacific program at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S. \"It could end up with a major display of military force by the Chinese, which will introduce even more friction into the U.S.-China relationship,\" she said. China, which stated its displeasure at Ms. Tsai\\'s trip, opened formal diplomatic relations over the weekend with Honduras , which cut its decades-old ties with Taiwan. Ms. Tsai\\'s trip takes her to two of Taiwan\\'s 13 remaining diplomatic partners, Guatemala and Belize, neighbors of Honduras. Ms. Tsai\\'s stops in the U.S. are officially called \"transit\" visits—language that is part of the delicate diplomacy meant to maintain a U.S.-China-Taiwan equilibrium . Taiwanese presidents have made dozens of such visits over the years, including several by Ms. Tsai, with minimal pushback from Beijing , Biden administration officials said. \"There is no reason for Beijing to turn this transit, which is consistent with longstanding U.S. policy, into something it is not or use it to overreact,\" the State Department said. But China carefully scrutinizes the visits for signs that the U.S. and Taiwan are testing the limits of Beijing\\'s tolerance, and Taiwan\\'s leaders at times have pushed the envelope to try to show their influence in the U.S. House Speaker McCarthy would be the highest-level U.S. politician to meet a Taiwan president on American soil since the transit visits started. Ties now between Taiwan and the U.S. are more robust than at any time since Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, according to officials and political analysts, with more communication among defense officials and higher-level contacts between the governments. That closeness puts immense pressure on Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who has said the Taiwan issue should not be passed from generation to generation. Beijing has put off U.S. requests earlier this month for Mr. Xi and President Biden to speak by phone in an effort by the administration to settle some of the recent rancor. Beijing wants to wait to see how Ms. Tsai\\'s visit plays out before agreeing to any leader-level call, Chinese officials said. \"We strongly oppose any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, strongly oppose any U.S. visit by the leader of the Taiwan authorities regardless of the rationale or pretext,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters last week. \"The reported trip is not so much a \\'transit,\\' but an attempt to seek breakthroughs and propagate \\'Taiwan independence.\\'\" A successful trip would help Ms. Tsai show that her party can manage close relations with the U.S. without provoking a harsh response from Beijing. That would boost her current vice president\\'s chances of winning a pivotal election to succeed her early next year when her two terms as president end. \"China has been ramping up its aggressive behavior and this is a general concern,\" said Kolas Yotaka, a spokeswoman for Ms. Tsai. \"We think the best response is deeper cooperation with our partners to safeguard peace in the region and protect our common democratic values.\" This week, Ms. Tsai\\'s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, began a 12-day tour of China, the first former president of Taiwan to set foot in the mainland since 1949. Ms. Tsai\\'s office has sought to play down the China trip by Mr. Ma, who favored closer ties with Beijing when he was president between 2008 and 2016. Some lawmakers from Mr. Ma\\'s party, the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, and members of the public have voiced concern that the island might be dragged into war as part of U.S.-China rivalry. Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, along with Beijing\\'s stepped-up military pressure on Taiwan, has created a sense of urgency within Ms. Tsai\\'s government and the U.S. about the need to harden Taiwan for eventual conflict . Early this year, Washington and Beijing seemed poised for detente. Tensions had subsided from their last bout of friction over Taiwan: then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\'s visit to the island in August . Then, the U.S. detected the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon crossing North America and delayed high-level talks with Beijing before shooting down the craft, further angering Chinese leadership. Both sides have drawn sharper lines over the war in Ukraine, with Mr. Xi holding a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week. Beijing, which has bolstered Moscow by buying energy and boosting trade, has tried to position itself as a potential peacemaker and portrayed the U.S. as irresponsible for arming Kyiv. One concern for the administration is a closed-door reception on Thursday in New York by the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, to award Ms. Tsai its global leadership award. A current fellow at the institute is Mike Pompeo, the former Trump administration secretary of state who, while visiting Taiwan last year, urged in a Facebook post that the U.S. grant formal diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. The Biden administration has said U.S. policy remains unchanged. A move to formal recognition of Taiwan would likely be seen by Beijing as a reneging on four decades of U.S. diplomatic commitments and potentially cross a red line China has set out for triggering military action. Hudson said Mr. Pompeo isn\\'t attending. The think tank declined to release a list of invitees and other details of the event. On her way back from visiting Guatemala and Belize, Ms. Tsai is due to meet at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library with House Speaker McCarthy. Other Republican members of Congress, including Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, who leads a special committee on U.S. competition with China\\'s Communist Party, are expected to attend. Taiwan\\'s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said last week that Ms. Tsai would also meet with members of the Democratic Party. In Taipei, government and ruling party officials are concerned that any misstep during Ms. Tsai\\'s trip might put further strain on its troubled relationship with Beijing—or mar relations with Washington. Some lawmakers in the opposition Kuomintang, along with pro-opposition media and a number of academics, have suggested that the U.S. is treating Taiwan like a pawn in its competition with Beijing. Some pointed to chipmaking powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\\'s decision to build a $40 billion facto ry in Arizona, saying it amounts to forced technology transfer that primarily benefits the U.S. \"The Americans are our good friends and have helped us so much over the past several decades, but I remain skeptical,\" Kuomintang lawmaker Wu Sz-huai said during an appearance by Taiwan\\'s foreign minister before the legislature last week. \"They put their own national interests first, not Taiwan\\'s national interests.\" Taiwan\\'s government has characterized some of the criticisms as misinformation designed to weaken ties between Washington and Taipei and predicted such attacks would intensify ahead of the 2024 presidential election.',\n",

House Republicans are struggling to unite behind a detailed plan on a GOP budget laying out their priorities, as well as a separate decision over what concessions to demand in return for voting to increase the debt ceiling. The lack of a clear path forward has become conspicuous in recent weeks. After Rep. Jodey Arrington (R., Texas), the House Budget Committee chair, said that he was completing a list of demands for debt-ceiling talks and spending cuts, Mr. McCarthy flatly told reporters last week: \"I have no idea what he is talking about.\" \"My focus is on the budget resolution, his focus is on the debt ceiling,\" Mr. Arrington said in an interview on Tuesday.

       " 'Mar 28, 2023': ['WASHINGTON—House Speaker Kevin McCarthy tried to prod President Biden into starting talks over spending cuts as a condition for raising the debt ceiling , just as Republicans are struggling to unite around a blueprint for negotiations ahead of dual deadlines later this year. The White House released its own budget proposal earlier this month and has said it won\\'t negotiate on spending until Republicans put forward their own plan. Mr. McCarthy has rejected that notion and said in a letter to Mr. Biden that talks should start as soon as possible. While neither budget would have a chance of becoming law, they serve to outline the parties\\' policy intentions. \"The budget has nothing to do with the debt ceiling,\" Mr. McCarthy told reporters . \"Let\\'s get the debt ceiling done and stop playing games.\" In his letter to Mr. Biden on Tuesday morning, the California Republican reiterated that he wanted to roll back nondefense discretionary spending and lock in low annual increases from there, while also proposing clawing back unspent Covid-19 relief funds and strengthening work requirements for social programs. He also called for measures to lower energy costs and secure the border, two priorities for House Republicans. The White House dismissed the letter, calling again for the House to pass a debt ceiling increase with no spending cuts attached—leaving any talks at an impasse. Mr. Biden has said the debt limit needed to be raised without conditions but has said he would engage in discussions over taxes and spending once Mr. McCarthy produces his budget plan. Many lawmakers expect the GOP budget to be completed in May or later. Mr. Biden \"has put forward his budget, and all he\\'s asking in return is to see what the House Republicans will put forward. I think that\\'s pretty reasonable,\" said White House spokeswoman Olivia Dalton. The Treasury Departmen t ran up against the roughly $31.4 trillion debt limit in January. It is now deploying a series of special accounting maneuvers to keep paying the government\\'s obligations to bondholders, Social Security recipients and others. The U.S. could become unable to pay all of its bills as soon as this summer. \"At the moment, I don\\'t see how we get there,\" Rep. Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.) chairman of the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said at a Punchbowl News event on Tuesday regarding a path to raising the debt ceiling. \"And this is a marked change from where I\\'ve been,\" he said, noting the lack of conversations with the White House. House Republicans are struggling to unite behind a detailed plan on a GOP budget laying out their priorities, as well as a separate decision over what concessions to demand in return for voting to increase the debt ceiling. The lack of a clear path forward has become conspicuous in recent weeks. After Rep. Jodey Arrington (R., Texas), the House Budget Committee chair, said that he was completing a list of demands for debt-ceiling talks and spending cuts, Mr. McCarthy flatly told reporters last week: \"I have no idea what he is talking about.\" \"My focus is on the budget resolution, his focus is on the debt ceiling,\" Mr. Arrington said in an interview on Tuesday. Asked about how the two would intersect, he said the debt-ceiling proposal might need to readied before a budget resolution, which would include a longer list of spending cuts across numerous government programs and open Republicans up to political attacks. Still, Mr. Arrington said he was directing his efforts at getting a budget passed with support of Republicans. \"I have to herd the butterflies to a 218 threshold,\" he said.

       "  'The U.S. and China have described Taiwan as the most volatile flashpoint in their increasingly fraught bilateral relations. Now, after months of sparring by Washington and Beijing over the Ukraine war, a suspected surveillance balloon , TikTok and other issues, Taiwan is set to return to the center of great power tensions, with the island\\'s leader traveling to the U.S. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen is stopping in New York and Los Angeles on her way to and from Central America, with plans to meet House Speaker Kevin McCarthy next week in California. Some in the Biden administration are concerned that the visit will give Beijing the pretext to conduct military exercises near the island , as it did last summer, or erode Taiwan\\'s security in other ways, according to officials. As Ms. Tsai\\'s arrival in New York on Wednesday approaches, U.S. officials have been sounding out Ms. Tsai\\'s government to ensure her trip stays within past norms, while also urging Beijing against reacting strongly , the officials and people familiar with the talks said. Visits by Taiwanese presidents to the U.S. are always carefully managed affairs, with Washington trying to give the island\\'s leaders a way to show their government has U.S. support, without giving Beijing an opening for forceful retaliation. How the three governments handle the visit is likely to determine whether Washington- Beijing relations deteriorate further. All three are readying their militaries for a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is a longstanding U.S. partner that Beijing regards as its territory, and domestic politics make compromise difficult for each. \"There is a possibility that the transit, if not carefully handled, could blow up in everybody\\'s face,\" said Bonnie Glaser, who heads the Indo-Pacific program at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S. \"It could end up with a major display of military force by the Chinese, which will introduce even more friction into the U.S.-China relationship,\" she said. China, which stated its displeasure at Ms. Tsai\\'s trip, opened formal diplomatic relations over the weekend with Honduras , which cut its decades-old ties with Taiwan. Ms. Tsai\\'s trip takes her to two of Taiwan\\'s 13 remaining diplomatic partners, Guatemala and Belize, neighbors of Honduras. Ms. Tsai\\'s stops in the U.S. are officially called \"transit\" visits—language that is part of the delicate diplomacy meant to maintain a U.S.-China-Taiwan equilibrium . Taiwanese presidents have made dozens of such visits over the years, including several by Ms. Tsai, with, Biden administration officials said, minimal pushback from Beijing . \"There is no reason for Beijing to turn this transit, which is consistent with longstanding U.S. policy, into something it is not or use it to overreact,\" the State Department said. But China carefully scrutinizes the visits for signs that the U.S. and Taiwan are testing the limits of Beijing\\'s tolerance, and Taiwan\\'s leaders at times have pushed the envelope to try to show their influence in the U.S. House Speaker McCarthy would be the highest-level U.S. politician to meet a Taiwan president on American soil since the transit visits started. Ties now between Taiwan and the U.S. are more robust than at any time since Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, according to officials and political analysts, with more communication among defense officials and higher-level contacts between the governments. That closeness puts immense pressure on Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who has said China\\'s goal of taking control of Taiwan should not be left to the next generation. Beijing has put off U.S. requests earlier this month for Mr. Xi and President Biden to speak by phone in an effort by the administration to settle some of the recent rancor. Beijing wants to wait to see how Ms. Tsai\\'s visit plays out before agreeing to any leader-level call, Chinese officials said. \"We strongly oppose any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, strongly oppose any U.S. visit by the leader of the Taiwan authorities regardless of the rationale or pretext,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters last week. \"The reported trip is not so much a \\'transit,\\' but an attempt to seek breakthroughs and propagate \\'Taiwan independence.\\'\" A successful trip would help Ms. Tsai show that her party can manage close relations with the U.S. without provoking a harsh response from Beijing. That would boost her current vice president\\'s chances of winning a pivotal election to succeed her early next year when her two terms as president end. \"China has been ramping up its aggressive behavior and this is a general concern,\" said Kolas Yotaka, a spokeswoman for Ms. Tsai. \"We think the best response is deeper cooperation with our partners to safeguard peace in the region and protect our common democratic values.\" This week, Ms. Tsai\\'s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, began a 12-day tour of China, the first former president of Taiwan to set foot in the mainland since 1949. Ms. Tsai\\'s office has sought to play down the China trip by Mr. Ma, who favored closer ties with Beijing when he was president between 2008 and 2016. Some lawmakers from Mr. Ma\\'s party, the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, and members of the public have voiced concern that the island might be dragged into war as part of U.S.-China rivalry. Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, along with Beijing\\'s stepped-up military pressure on Taiwan, has created a sense of urgency within Ms. Tsai\\'s government and the U.S. about the need to harden Taiwan for eventual conflict . Early this year, Washington and Beijing seemed poised for detente. Tensions had subsided from their last bout of friction over Taiwan: then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\'s visit to the island in August . Then, the U.S. detected the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon crossing North America and delayed high-level talks with Beijing before shooting down the craft, further angering the Chinese leadership. Both sides have drawn sharper lines over the war in Ukraine, with Mr. Xi holding a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week. Beijing, which has bolstered Moscow by buying energy and boosting trade, has tried to position itself as a potential peacemaker and portrayed the U.S. as irresponsible for arming Kyiv. One concern for the administration is a closed-door reception on Thursday in New York by the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, to award Ms. Tsai its global leadership award. A current fellow at the institute is Mike Pompeo, the former Trump administration secretary of state who, while visiting Taiwan last year, urged in a Facebook post that the U.S. grant formal diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. The Biden administration has said U.S. policy remains unchanged. A move to formal recognition of Taiwan would likely be seen by Beijing as a reneging on four decades of U.S. diplomatic commitments and potentially cross a red line China has set out for triggering military action. The think tank declined to release a list of invitees and other details of the event. A spokesman for Mr. Pompeo didn\\'t immediately respond to a request for comment. On her way back from visiting Guatemala and Belize, Ms. Tsai is due to meet at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library with House Speaker McCarthy. Other Republican members of Congress, including Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, who leads a special committee on U.S. competition with China\\'s Communist Party, are expected to attend. Taiwan\\'s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said last week that Ms. Tsai would also meet with members of the Democratic Party. In Taipei, government and ruling party officials are concerned that any misstep during Ms. Tsai\\'s trip may put further strain on its troubled relationship with Beijing—or mar relations with Washington. Some lawmakers in the opposition Kuomintang, along with pro-opposition media and a number of academics, have suggested that the U.S. is treating Taiwan like a pawn in its competition with Beijing. Some pointed to chipmaking powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\\'s decision to build a $40 billion facto ry in Arizona, saying it amounts to forced technology transfer that primarily benefits the U.S. \"The Americans are our good friends and have helped us so much over the past several decades, but I remain skeptical,\" Kuomintang lawmaker Wu Sz-huai said during an appearance by Taiwan\\'s foreign minister before the legislature last week. \"They put their own national interests first, not Taiwan\\'s national interests.\" Taiwan\\'s government has characterized some of the criticisms as misinformation designed to weaken ties between Washington and Taipei and predicted such attacks would intensify ahead of the 2024 presidential election.',\n",
       "  'HOUSTON—Wael Sawan knows he is about to make some people very unhappy. The new chief executive of Shell PLC is in the midst of crafting his business plan for the London-based energy giant, including whether to increase oil production. Doing so would please many investors looking to build on last year\\'s oil-and-gas bonanza, which produced record annual earnings for Shell. But it almost certainly would generate howls of protest from environmentalists and other critics, including investors who want Shell to tackle climate-related goals more aggressively. Those investors argue a continued focus on fossil fuels endangers Shell\\'s long-term prospects in a changing world. Mr. Sawan says he is committed to lowering the company\\'s emissions and helping develop a new generation of clean-energy sources. But that is not where the bulk of profits are right now. \"I fundamentally believe in the role of oil and gas for a long, long time to come,\" he said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal. What\\'s more, he said, he doesn\\'t believe renewable- and low-carbon energy projects should be subsidized by Shell\\'s fossil-fuel profits, but should deliver returns that merit continued investment on their own. \"We\\'re definitely taking a hard look at the portfolio,\" Mr. Sawan said. All options are on the table , he said, including revising the company\\'s 2021 forecast for an average 1% to 2% decrease in its crude output each year until 2030. Mr. Sawan also said he was weighing further exploration for new sources of oil and gas in areas where Shell doesn\\'t currently operate. He cautioned that Shell\\'s production targets and other key decisions are still being debated by its executives and board. Whatever he decides, Mr. Sawan expects to be unpopular among some groups, and maybe factions of all of them. \"I think the heat will come no matter what I do,\" he said. Shell has scheduled an update for investors on June 14 in New York. Finding the balance between fossil fuels and lower-carbon alternatives is a big challenge facing the CEOs of the biggest energy companies . The task is particularly acute for Mr. Sawan and Shell, Europe\\'s biggest energy company, which moved to the U.K. after a Dutch court ruled in 2021 that it was partially responsible for climate change and must reduce its carbon emissions. Shell is appealing the ruling, arguing that it is being unreasonably singled out. In the U.K. and European continent, governments are clawing back portions of record profits earned last year by oil-and-gas companies as energy costs soared amid Russia\\'s war in Ukraine. Less than a year ago, Shell\\'s annual shareholder meeting in London was delayed by almost three hours by climate activists attending as shareholders, who glued themselves to chairs and chanted against the company\\'s continued spending on fossil fuels. Mr. Sawan, who joined Shell in 1997 at the age of 22, now becomes its public face . Born in Lebanon, Mr. Sawan grew up mostly in Dubai and studied chemical engineering in Montreal. A dual Lebanese-Canadian national, Mr. Sawan is the first non-European CEO in Shell\\'s history. Mr. Sawan is considered by colleagues inside and outside the company to be a technically adept manager, including in his most recent job overseeing Shell\\'s massive liquefied natural gas business, typically its biggest cash engine. He also took over responsibility for renewables on his final stretch toward the CEO job. Wael Sawan is Shell\\'s first non-European CEO. PHOTO: Mary Turner for The Wall Street Journal In addition to Europe and the Middle East, he has worked on the U.S. Gulf Coast and run businesses including global deep-water operations and companywide oil-and-gas exploration and production, known as upstream. A pivotal time in his career, according to people who know him, came in 1999 when, after working his first couple of years in Oman, he scored highly on the business-school entrance exam and considered leaving Shell to pursue his graduate business degree at Harvard University. Andy Brown, at the time his boss and later head of all upstream production for Shell, said he persuaded Mr. Sawan not to leave, but to get his M.B.A. with Shell\\'s support and then afterward to return to the company. He later followed in Mr. Brown\\'s footsteps in the Middle East overseeing Shell\\'s Qatar operations. \"It was clear that Wael was a great talent,\" Mr. Brown said. \"When you\\'re 24, it is about, is the guy smart and can he work through issues and problems?\" He said Mr. Sawan was especially skilled at developing relationships with business partners and government officials. That proved a valuable asset as Mr. Sawan traveled the world, people who know him said. He could defuse tensions by connecting with government leaders and executives over a shared love of soccer, or regional food, they said. In Qatar, Mr. Sawan helped steer a huge natural-gas refinery development project through cost hurdles and delays, earning internal recognition for his diplomacy with government officials and other partners, people involved in the project say. People close to Mr. Sawan said they expect him to be tested at the helm, not just by navigating Shell\\'s business challenges but also by what they describe as his natural reluctance to confide in fellow executives, as well as the time he\\'ll be separated from his wife and sons. Since getting the top job last year, Mr. Sawan has spent time consulting with business heads but also periods in near-isolation working through details of businesses in preparation for a full review, people familiar with his schedule said. \"It\\'s a massively intense job, and you sort of need to build the stamina for it,\" Mr. Sawan said. \"I\\'m trying to stick to my gym patterns, my eating patterns, to make sure that you stay sane at the end of it and still enjoy life after it.\" Among the options under consideration is whether it might make sense for Shell to step up exploration for new oil-and-gas sources, Mr. Sawan said. That includes potentially looking far afield for new, untapped oil and gas sources in parts of the world known in the industry as \"frontiers\" because they lack production infrastructure that takes years, sometimes decades, to build into full production. A Shell oil platform at a shipyard in Corpus Christi, Texas. PHOTO: Christopher Lee for The Wall Street Journal Shell said two years ago it plans to end all new frontier exploration by the end of 2025, giving the company a finite window to search for virgin reservoirs of oil and gas where it isn\\'t already operating. Dwindling options for limiting global warming call for a massive and rapid shift away from fossil fuels, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report last week . At the same time, oil demand is continuing to rise, and investors in global oil giants have rewarded companies—including U.S. giants Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp.— for sticking with traditional fossil-fuel production. Shell says it is ahead of its schedule on planned annual 1% to 2% crude-output cuts, from divesting or running off assets more quickly than expected. \"We\\'re almost at the point where we had expected to be by 2030,\" Mr. Sawan said. \"That gives us options to be able to choose how we want to go from here. It\\'s those options that we\\'re assessing.\" To illustrate what he considers a smart approach to new-energy projects, he noted Shell\\'s decision—overseen by him—to build what the company expects to be Europe\\'s largest renewable hydrogen plant, in Rotterdam, once it is up and running in 2025. \"There\\'s a great opportunity for that to be a double-digit return,\" Mr. Sawan said. \"Let\\'s prove the concept. If we can prove the concept, then maybe the second one will be built and the third one, but it has to be done in a measured way.\"',\n",
       "  'WASHINGTON—Republicans and Democrats are sparring over measures in the $53 billion Chips Act that the Biden administration says are needed to ensure the measure\\'s success, but which Republicans say are an effort to pursue liberal social policies. The Commerce Department has set rules for semiconductor companies seeking grants under the act that encourage the hiring of union workforces and economically disadvantaged individuals. Companies seeking more than $150 million must provide child care. A group of Republican U.S. senators including Ted Cruz (R., Texas) and Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) recently wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo saying that the measures will make \"domestic chip production more expensive, less competitive, and reliant on taxpayer subsidies over private investment.\" In an interview, Ms. Raimondo pushed back on those claims. She said measures such as requiring chip makers to pay prevailing wages and provide child care are necessary to address a workforce shortage that could hinder efforts to expand semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. \"There is zero \\'social policy\\' that we\\'re trying to achieve here,\" Ms. Raimondo said. \"We have no desire to put requirements on companies that are bad for the companies.\" She added that the success of the Chips Act largely hinges on overcoming a labor shortage that could imperil plans to compete with China by boosting domestic chip production at home. \"We want them to show us a workforce plan, including how they think about child care, not because we have a social agenda but because we know [that] they\\'re struggling to hire workers,\" Ms. Raimondo said. \"We do need to protect taxpayer money and make sure the projects get done successfully, on time and on budget.\" Ms. Raimondo is expected to join President Biden in North Carolina on Tuesday for a visit to a semiconductor manufacturer in Durham that has plans to build a $5 billion chip-manufacturing plant projected to create 1,800 new jobs. During the visit, Mr. Biden will say that more than $435 billion in private-sector manufacturing commitments have been made since he took office, according to a White House official, who didn\\'t specify a time frame for when the investments would be made. The total includes more than $200 billion in clean energy, electric vehicle and battery investments, over $200 billion in semiconductors, and about $15 billion in biomanufacturing investments. The event will kick off a three-week tour that will see Mr. Biden and other top administration officials visit key battleground states to tout legislative accomplishments as the president gears up for a likely re-election campaign where the impact of his domestic economic policies is expected to be a core theme. Mr. Biden\\'s approval rating neared the lowest point of his presidency in a new poll while another recent survey found most Americans think the president has accomplished \"not very much\" or \"little or nothing\" during his tenure. Mr. Biden and his administration are now ramping up efforts to sell the impact of its policies as the president begins making the case for a second term, although he has yet to formally launch his re-election campaign. In their letter, dated March 22, the 14 Republican senators said that many of the rules the Biden administration has imposed on chip subsidy applicants weren\\'t specified in the Chips Act. Their criticism echoed prior complaints from Republicans that conditions for companies applying for the first round of semiconductor funding are being used \"as a tool to pursue controversial policies that go beyond the requirements of the law.\" This includes sharing profit that exceed projections with the government and favoring applicants who commit to pursuing \"environmental justice\" measures. The Republicans said the Commerce Department\\'s criteria will add to companies\\' costs for building facilities and making the U.S. less competitive against other manufacturing nations. Ms. Raimondo said preferences added by the department on child care and workforce development are aimed at speeding up the launch of the projects amid the shortage of workers. She said that the department will take a holistic approach and negotiate terms of the agreement flexibly with individual companies as it applies the criteria stated in the application materials. She added that the department\\'s primary goal is to get the projects up and running quickly and efficiently, and that the request to submit plans is to make sure the projects are built on time and on budget and staffed effectively. \"The way you\\'re going to meet your workforce needs in rural Idaho is different than in Texas or New York,\" she said. \"We\\'re not going to predetermine the way they fulfill these projects.\" The Chips Act passed Congress with bipartisan support last year, marking another bipartisan achievement for Mr. Biden after the passage of the $1 trillion infrastructure law in November 2021. In the Senate, 17 Republicans joined a nearly unanimous Democratic caucus in favor of the bill, while two dozen Republicans crossed party lines to help pass it in the House. Ms. Raimondo lobbied both Democrats and Republicans amid negotiations around the legislation, with an emphasis on the national-security concerns of continuing to rely on Taiwan or U.S. adversaries for semiconductors. Companies building leading-edge chip factories in the U.S. can begin applying for the Chips Act funds Friday. The application process for companies looking to build current generation and mature technology facilities opens June 26.',\n",
       "  \"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Japan reached a trade agreement for minerals used in clean-energy technologies, a deal aimed at allowing Japan to meet sourcing requirements for new electric-vehicle subsidies in the U.S. and shifting energy supply chains away from China. Under the deal, the U.S. and Japan agreed not to levy export duties on critical minerals they trade and coordinate labor standards in producing minerals, among other steps, according to a U.S. announcement. The pact builds on a limited trade accord the two countries reached in 2019, and they will review the minerals deal every two years to see if they should end or change it. The Biden administration has started pursuing trade deals with close allies on critical minerals as it tries to address two problems: restrictions it has placed on new subsidies for electric vehicles and China's current dominance of the supply of minerals such as lithium and graphite that are necessary for making electric vehicles. The Inflation Reduction Act overhauled a tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles. Among the new requirements for qualifying for the full $7,500 credit is that much of the minerals in a vehicle's battery must come from the U.S. or a country with a free-trade agreement with the U.S. Many U.S. allies, including Japan, the European Union and U.K., don't have traditional free-trade pacts with the U.S. Biden administration officials crafted the deal with Tokyo in such a way that minerals from Japan will now meet the sourcing requirement for the new subsidy -- while not having to launch lengthy, politically difficult negotiations over broader trading issues.\",\n",

The Inflation Reduction Act—the broad climate, healthcare and tax package Congress passed last year—overhauled a tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles. Among the new requirements for qualifying for the full $7,500 credit is that much of the minerals in a vehicle\\'s battery must come from the U.S. or a country with a free-trade agreement with the U.S. Many close U.S. allies, including Japan, the European Union and U.K., don\\'t have traditional free-trade agreements with the U.S. Biden administration officials crafted the deal with Tokyo in such a way that minerals from Japan will now meet the sourcing requirement for the new subsidy—while not having to launch lengthy, politically difficult negotiations over broader trading issues. The U.S. is negotiating a similar trade agreement with the EU focused on critical minerals, with plans to also try and strike a deal with the U.K. \"This is a welcome moment as the United States continues to work with our allies and partners to strengthen supply chains for critical minerals, including through the Inflation Reduction Act,\" U.S. Trade Rep. Katherine Tai said. The U.S. and Japan are expected to sign the agreement Tuesday, when it will go into effect. Ms. Tai\\'s Japanese counterpart, trade minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, also welcomed the deal, saying minerals such as lithium, cobalt and nickel are important because of rising demand for EV batteries. With the subsidies, the U.S. is trying to encourage companies to develop new supply chains for critical minerals outside of China. As the U.S. relationship with China becomes increasingly adversarial, officials across Washington worry that relying on China for materials crucial for clean-energy technologies could leave the U.S. vulnerable. While China currently dominates the processing and refining of many critical minerals, Biden administration officials believe Japan, which already processes and refines critical minerals, could become a major part of an overhauled supply chain for the goods. Since the Biden administration is using executive authority to reach the agreement with Japan, it will not submit it to Congress for approval. The deal doesn\\'t lift any trading barriers, and a senior Biden administration official said the U.S. and Japan currently impose no export duties for trading critical minerals between their countries. The two countries also agreed to share information about reviewing foreign investments into the minerals sector. Lawmakers in both parties have criticized the administration\\'s push to make the agreements without receiving approval from Congress , calling it a violation of their constitutional authority. Biden administration officials have said they have consulted closely with lawmakers on the efforts. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), a chief architect of the Inflation Reduction Act, has said that he intended for close U.S. allies and partners to meet the sourcing requirement for the electric-vehicle subsidies without needing additional trade agreements. \"I gotta be honest with you. I should have paused and said \\'OK, I\\'m going to make sure our NATO allies are involved in this,\\' \" Mr. Manchin said at a recent energy conference in Houston. Mr. Manchin has been critical of several other choices the Biden administration has made in implementing the law. Biden administration officials see critical minerals agreements with members of the Group of Seven advanced democracies as the first piece of a broader strategy to reorient global supply chains away from China. Western officials have discussed forming a buyers club for critical minerals . Under such a buyers club, wealthy G-7 nations would offer financing and other development support to countries such as Zambia that are rich in the resources—an effort to convince these nations to sell their minerals to the West instead of China. —Yuka Hayashi and Jenny Strasburg contributed to this article.',\n",
       "  'WASHINGTON—President Biden\\'s choice to head the nation\\'s coming 250th anniversary commemorations is planning to relaunch the project on July 4, promising to get beyond the internal squabbles, mismanagement allegations and mushrooming litigation that have paralyzed the project for years. At a closed-door meeting Monday, Rosie Rios, chair of the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission, secured members\\' approval for her plans, which include gathering suggestions from the public about how the anniversary should be observed. She also intends to ask Congress for a significant increase in the commission\\'s annual appropriation. Ms. Rios, who was U.S. treasurer in the Obama administration, said her new initiative, America\\'s Invitation, would encourage \"the American public to suggest their own ideas, tell their own stories, share interesting narratives about their own experiences, about their own communities.\" Those suggestions would lead to a multiyear planning effort for 2026, she said, and \"a playbook that basically says, \\'Americans have spoken, this is what we want to do.\\'\" The struggles of the anniversary project, known as America250, have included a botched alliance with Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., a defamation suit by one commissioner against others, and a workplace discrimination case against the project pending in federal court. The effort has consumed millions of dollars since Congress created the Semiquincentennial Commission in 2016. Other agencies aren\\'t waiting for America250 to take the lead. \"We\\'re each kind of doing things on our own,\" said Crosby Kemper, who as director of the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services holds a nonvoting seat on the commission. America250, he said, has been so consumed by \"organizational messiness that they haven\\'t gotten terribly far. For a long period of time there hasn\\'t been anyone there for us to talk to.\" Earlier this month, some 300 historians, curators and officials representing Semiquincentennial agencies, museums and historical organizations from more than 30 states met at the Colonial Williamsburg historic site in Virginia to begin nationwide planning on their own. \"We thought, \\'Let\\'s get together, let\\'s collaborate, let\\'s see where we can partner and make this meaningful nationally, across state boundaries,\\'\" said Cheryl Wilson, executive director of the Virginia American Revolution 250 Commission, adding that a couple of America250 commissioners attended. James Grossman, executive director of the American Historical Association, said while Ms. Rios brings new \"energy at the national level,\" other organizations \"have had to go off and say, \\'We are going to do something.\\'\" Congress established the Semiquincentennial Commission to coordinate programs nationwide and made the heads of a dozen federal agencies, including the Library of Congress, the National Archives and the Smithsonian Institution, nonvoting members. Several of those agencies are moving forward with their own projects independent of the commission. Ms. Rios said she welcomed efforts by other groups. Not all the work done by America250 to date was for naught, she said, citing the development of a logo for the anniversary and Congress\\'s approval for the minting of Semiquincentennial coins. Under former Chairman Daniel DiLella, the Semiquincentennial Commission gave its federal funds and program responsibilities to another entity, the America250 Foundation, where Mr. DiLella also was chairman. Several commissioners questioned the legality of the arrangement and the number of Mr. DiLella\\'s friends and business associates who received contracts and positions of responsibility with America250. Mr. DiLella has denied wrongdoing and sued three fellow commissioners who criticized him for defamation, an allegation they deny. Mr. DiLella said the project turned the corner in 2021 when Joseph Daniels, former president of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, was hired as executive director of the America250 Foundation. Mr. Daniels scrapped much of the organization\\'s initial planning and brought in his own team, but turmoil continued, including a discrimination lawsuit filed by female former executives and complaints from some commissioners that Mr. DiLella was running the organization with excessive secrecy and doing little to advance its mission. America250 denied the allegations and hired the firm Constangy Brooks Smith & Prophete to review the claims. According to a three-page executive summary circulated internally in September, the review found \"workplace culture issues\" but didn\\'t support the allegations of systemic problems. \"Several witnesses noted the challenges that the infighting among the commission and the pending lawsuit have created, not only on the work that they do for the foundation, but on the morale of the staff,\" the review said. In June, Meta canceled a $10 million sponsorship deal , citing \"leadership dysfunction\" at America250. The following month, President Biden replaced Mr. DiLella as chairman with Ms. Rios, a longtime commission member who had been on Mr. DiLella\\'s leadership team. At the request of Sen. Robert Casey (D., Pa.), who represented Senate Democrats on the commission, some lawmakers last year set aside $1 million for the Interior Department inspector general to investigate the Semiquincentennial project. Commission officials lobbied to kill that inquiry, and it ultimately was struck from the budget. Mr. Casey then resigned from the commission. \"Sen. Casey has been proud to represent the birthplace of our nation on the Semiquincentennial Commission, but he is no longer able to commit the amount of time and attention that he believes the commission needs,\" a spokeswoman said. Ms. Rios said she has taken steps to reorganize the project, parting ways with Mr. Daniels over what she called \"differing philosophies\" and consolidating commission and foundation operations. Mr. Daniels declined to comment. \"I\\'m not going to let any issues distract my team or me from the work that we need to do to deliver the best commemoration of America\\'s anniversary that\\'s ever been done,\" Ms. Rios said.'],\n",
       " 'Mar 27, 20 23': ['Lyft Inc., grappling with competition and a battered stock price , is tapping a board member as its chief executive, and its two co-founders will step back from managing the company, the ride-sharing company said Monday. David Risher, who had management stints at Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. before starting a childhood-reading nonprofit in 2009, will take over from Logan Green, who co-founded Lyft with current President John Zimmer. The pair will retain their seats on the board but not participate in running Lyft day-to-day. Mr. Risher has been a Lyft board member since 2021. \"The macroeconomy is tough and the world is full of some uncertainty and that\\'s a real factor for sure and, then, when you zoom in one click, the competitive environment is tough. We have a very aggressive—very aggressive—competitor,\" Mr. Risher said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \"I think being a strong number two is a good place to be,\" he added. \"I like where we are, but we\\'ve got real work to do to fight it out a little bit.\" Lyft shares rose around 4% in after-hours trading Monday after the Journal reported the news. Lyft has struggled to keep up with its larger rival Uber Technologies Inc. Uber now commands 74% of the U.S. ride-share market, up from 62% in early 2020, according to consumer receipts analyzed by market-research firm YipitData. Lyft\\'s market share has fallen to 26% from 38% over the same period, YipitData shows. Uber, which has a global and more diversified business, leveraged its food-delivery operations to deal with a driver shortage that crippled the ride-share industry as the economy reopened in 2021. Lyft chose not to get into food delivery and operates within the U.S. and Canada. Uber moved more quickly than Lyft to attract drivers with bonuses and some new features, many of which Lyft later implemented. Lyft hasn\\'t reported an annual profit since its inception in 2012, but it has been trimming its losses. Last month, the company announced a weaker-than-expected revenue outlook for the current quarter. Late last year, the San Francisco-based company laid off more than 700 employees or 13% of staff and scaled back on other businesses, such as renting cars to customers, as it looked to weather a possible recession. Its stock has tumbled over 74% in the past 12 months. Uber\\'s shares have fallen around 10% over that period. Messrs. Zimmer and Green said in an interview that they were stepping down for personal reasons. Mr. Green, who has four children, said he approached the board about finding a successor after his 39th birthday late last year \"prompted some reflections in terms of what I want in life.\" Mr. Risher said he was approached for the job earlier this year. \"This recent decision to pass the torch to David feels really good,\" Mr. Zimmer said. \"There\\'s always things we could have done differently or better.\" One of the decisions that Mr. Green said he would reconsider was limiting Lyft\\'s business to North America. Uber spent its early years expanding overseas, from where it now gets about 40% of its revenue. There is \"still a lot of upside and a lot of room\" for international expansion, Mr. Green said. Mr. Risher wouldn\\'t say if he had plans to expand internationally. Mr. Green controls more than 20% of shareholder voting rights at the company. His interest in transportation was sparked by a stint in Zimbabwe as a college student when he noticed how carpooling was a popular option among neighbors and thought that there must be a better way to utilize all the empty car seats in the U.S. Mr. Zimmer worked at Lehman Brothers before giving that up to move to San Francisco to help launch the company which became Lyft. He has special shares that give him around 12% of the voting rights for the company. Mr. Zimmer said Monday that he had ferried passengers as a Lyft driver on New Year\\'s Eve for more than a decade. The new CEO, Mr. Risher, said he hopes to add to what the two have built. \"My real opportunity is to take that foundation and take it to the next level,\" Mr. Risher said. \"A new person can help bring in even new energy. That\\'s job one right now.\"'],\n",
       " 'Mar 27, 2023': ['Some financial regulators appear to have seized on a series of high-profile meltdowns to go around Congress and try to freeze an entire industry out of banking services. I spent more than a decade as a federal prosecutor on some of the worst threats our country faces—organized crime, the opioid epidemic, political corruption and terrorism. In my final years at the Justice Department, I shifted to cases involving emerging technology, including the then-nascent crypto category, from the Mt. Gox hack to the corrupt Silk Road agents . Years later, the space continues to attract crime and fraud, but it has also drawn some of the brightest engineering talent in the world. Public blockchains, the foundational technology of the ecosystem, are an important set of tools that reflect breakthroughs in cryptography and distributed computing. In addition to early financial-use cases, this sector provides new ways to develop, monetize and govern all kinds of software. Unfortunately, members of this computing vanguard are being lumped in with the bad actors as part of a coordinated regulatory campaign to stymie progress in the sector. While other countries are putting in place laws and regulations, in the U.S. unelected officials are making major policy decisions about whether or not America should have a crypto industry. These efforts are misguided, reckless and potentially unconstitutional. Most important, they put America on the dangerous path of closing off the banking system to those disfavored by a particular administration. In January, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve issued a statement notifying financial institutions to be on alert for customers operating in the space, saying decentralized networks are \"highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.\" This ominous statement, coupled with seeming behind-the-scenes discouragement by their regulators, has led many banks to begin steering clear of almost any business touching blockchain technologies. In subsequent weeks, numerous banks shut their doors to this emerging sector, and regulators reportedly are conditioning sales of distressed banks on severing ties with the industry. A decade ago, in an effort called Operation Choke Point, the Justice Department, the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC tried to circumvent Congress using similar tactics—pressuring banks to cease business with specific industries , citing fraud prevention. Today, we are again seeing backroom tactics as a substitute for legislation, process and public regulation. Regardless of one\\'s position on the underlying issue, these significant policy decisions should be made in an open and transparent way. This extralegal crackdown initially might not concern observers whose impressions of crypto are rooted in headlines about bad actors and outright criminals. But as four senators pointed out in a recent letter to the Fed, the FDIC and the OCC: \"When the Bernie Madoff fraud was uncovered, regulators did not pressure banks to cut off access to other asset managers.\" The teams my firm works with are developing applications beyond financial services. One CEO is a former Green Beret whose company is building products to keep personal data safe using cryptography. Others include a serial entrepreneur creating developer tools for decentralized technologies, and a team building tax and compliance software for digital assets. Several Coinbase alumni are building products that help creators monetize digital content outside TikTok and Meta-owned Instagram. These aren\\'t scofflaws in cargo shorts committing theft. Whatever one believes about crypto (I realize many smart and reasonable people don\\'t yet see the potential or need), major U.S. policy decisions should be made by Congress and state legislatures, not by unelected officials. If financial regulators are concerned about specific risks and believe new rules are appropriate, then they should follow procedures, including public notice and comment. If legislation is needed, that\\'s up to Congress, but unelected officials shouldn\\'t try to destroy an industry by freezing it out of the banking system. Imagine if more than a century ago regulators had cut Ford and General Motors off from banking services because they considered automobiles too risky, or too competitive with trains and horses. In 1980, Massachusetts securities regulators barred citizens from buying stock in Apple\\'s IPO on the grounds that it was too \"risky.\" In the future, what if financial regulators were to warn banks against taking artificial-intelligence or alternative-energy customers because they\\'re too risky? And because of semiconductors we now know what happens when America fails to keep key industries onshore. Meanwhile, other countries are working on regulating digital assets through a public process. Just this month, the U.K. reaffirmed its commitment to provide a framework for consultation to regulate digital assets, and the EU recently introduced a harmonized set of rules for all 27 member countries. Singapore, Dubai and Japan are all establishing rules to provide clarity to the industry. Hong Kong is developing a crypto-licensing regime, with the apparent blessing of Beijing . If American lawmakers don\\'t provide a framework for decentralized technologies, then a major frontier of technological innovation will begin to move to more hospitable economies. America has long been a global leader in technology. Our regulators have risen to the occasion—not stifling innovation but embracing technological advances while maintaining a fair, honest and trusted playing field. But the expedient political view threatens to choke off innovation and punish legitimate actors. Every lawful business should have access to the banking system. Government censorship as a backdoor substitute for the legislative process has no place in finance—or any industry. Ms. Haun is CEO and founder of Haun Ventures, an investment firm specializing in decentralized technologies. She is a director of Coinbase and a former federal prosecutor.',\n",
       "  \"Dark clouds hovering over the U.S. banking sector may have ironically created a silver lining for emerging economies in Asia—lower oil prices. That comes as the key growth driver for much of the region, China, is ramping back up. Usually that would mean higher energy prices too, and inflation. But this time energy-hungry emerging Asian economies appear poised to benefit from China's reopening when inflationary pressures are actually easing. A slowdown in developed world demand will still hit exports. But emerging Asia—especially Chinese-tourism dependent economies such as Thailand and Singapore—could end up as growth outperformers this year if oil prices stay low and China's reopening stays on track. Both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are still focused on curbing inflation: Both central banks delivered a 0.25-percentage-point hike last week despite U.S. bank failures and the distressed sale of Credit Suisse in Switzerland. But monetary tightening has already slowed or stopped in most emerging Asian economies, such as India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia. Brent crude oil prices have fallen 10% in the last three months, according to Refinitiv data, and about 38% from their peak last year. Food prices are falling too. A United Nations' index of food-commodity costs eased 0.6% in February from January, down for the 11th straight month. That combination of falling food and oil prices is especially important for many Asian emerging markets, since food and energy tend to be a bigger portion of inflation baskets in poorer economies, and key Asian EMs are big food or energy importers. That contrasts with Latin America, where agricultural heavyweights such as Brazil get a lift from rising soy or meat prices. At the same time, the sturm and drang in the U.S. banking sector, which has seen the failure of midsize lender Silicon Valley Bank and another bank in recent weeks, isn't likely to have much direct impact on Asian EMs. Goldman Sachs reckons that U.S. bank closures and the consequent likely tightening of U.S. lending standards matter for Asia only to the extent they slow U.S. or foreign demand growth. Australian bank ANZ thinks that even if U.S. growth eases, the impact on Asia will be offset by China's reopening—actually boosting its safe-haven appeal. To be sure, export oriented economies like Vietnam will take a hit if demand from advanced economies slows sharply. And oil prices could still bounce back, especially if China's industrial and construction sectors increase further in the second half of the year. But a repeat of 2008—and its global fallout—doesn't seem likely, at least for now. Emerging Asia is famous for its perennial monsoons, typhoons and other extreme weather. In 2023, parts of it might actually end up as a storm shelter instead.\",\n",

       "  'HARSEWINKEL, Germany -- When Russia invaded Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin was counting on soaring energy prices and falling confidence to sink European companies, undermining the West\\'s support for Kyiv. One year later, many European companies have overcome the blow after slashing energy use and pivoting to a friendly and booming U.S. market. Such resilience has helped shore up political and popular support in Europe for Ukraine. Nowhere has the dynamic surprised as much as in Germany, a hub for energy-hungry manufacturers that had long relied on cheap supplies of Russian natural gas. Not only have German companies avoided the crash many economists predicted, but Berlin has also turned from relatively Kremlin-friendly into Kyiv\\'s third-biggest arms supplier. One of these companies is Claas KGaA mbH, a manufacturer of agricultural machinery with 5 billion euros of annual revenue, the equivalent of around $5.4 billion, and about 12,000 employees. When Moscow\\'s troops marched into Ukraine, Claas made about one quarter of its total sales in Central and Eastern Europe, including Russia. It has a large sales office in Ukraine and a plant in the Russian city of Krasnodar, 150 miles east of Crimea. Yet instead of retrenching, it cut production in Russia and China while increasing output at its main German factory by 30% last year. It reduced natural-gas consumption by almost one-third by making technical changes and has pivoted sales from Russia to the Americas. \"You look at what people and technical facilities you can use, and then you solve the problem,\" said Kai Gieselmann, a factory manager at Claas\\'s headquarters. Claas reported a 3% increase in annual output last year to almost 5 billion euros and a smaller, but healthy, profit. A 6% decline in sales in Central and Eastern Europe including Russia was more than offset by sales growth of 35% in the Americas. The changes wrought by Russia\\'s war \"won\\'t go away. One lesson is that we are somewhat maneuvering into a new normal,\" said Claas Chief Executive Thomas Bock. One of the biggest consequences of the Ukraine war for Claas was the redrawing of its global client map. The company still operates its Russian plant -- combine harvesters are exempt from sanctions, it says -- but has written off its investment there, valued at 40 million euros. As they scoured for alternative markets last year, executives settled on the Americas and especially the booming U.S. market. \"The market was there and the money was there,\" Mr. Bock said.',\n",
       "  'New York is poised to become the first state in the U.S. to pass a law banning natural-gas and other fossil-fuel hookups in new buildings, a step Democrats are pushing to help the state meet targets for greenhouse-gas reduction. The measure is on track to be added to the state\\'s coming budget, which is due to be completed this week. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in January pitched an all-electric building mandate in her spending plan, and both chambers of the Democratic-controlled State Legislature included similar proposals in their respective budget outlines. One of the legislation\\'s most noticeable effects would be an end to gas stoves in new homes, along with other gas-powered appliances such as water heaters, furnaces and clothes dryers. It faces opposition from some Republicans, labor unions, gas companies and business groups, citing concerns including affordability and reliability. Environmental groups have cheered the efforts. Democrats in Albany are still hammering out final details such as when the mandate would take effect, lawmakers said, though all proposals on the table take a phased-in approach. The suggested effective dates tossed around so far, for various kinds of buildings, range from as early as Jan. 1, 2025, to as late as Dec. 31, 2028. The Senate and Assembly measures would exempt uses such as commercial kitchens, hospitals, crematoriums, laboratories and laundromats, while the governor\\'s office said a range of exemptions would be possible. \"The basic premise here is that if you continue to build buildings that are going to require fossil fuels for decades to come, you are baking in. . .destructive behavior that burning fossil fuels causes,\" said Democratic state Sen. Brian Kavanagh, an advocate in the Senate. \"The first step is to stop digging the hole deeper.\" Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt said the proposals would remove options. \"Seeking a cleaner energy future does not have to involve outright prohibitions on reliable, affordable energy,\" he said. Controversy over gas stoves flared nationally earlier this year following a news report that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission was considering a gas-stove ban on indoor-air health concerns. Republicans and some centrist Democrats cast the Biden administration as trying to outlaw a beloved way of cooking. The White House said President Biden didn\\'t support a gas-stove ban. New Yorkers for Affordable Energy, a coalition that includes labor unions and gas companies, argues against a mandate, calling it unpopular with residents. A recent Siena College poll found that 53% of all New York respondents said they opposed the idea. \"Natural gas is going to continue to be part of the bridge between what we have now, with the heavy use of fossil fuel, and what we are going to have in the future,\" with more- renewable sources, said Daniel Ortega, of the coalition. \"Unless we are able to address reliability and affordability, none of this is going to work out.\" Under New York\\'s proposals for banning fossil-fuel hookups, people who already have gas stoves could keep them. Passage of a statewide building electrification requirement could spur other states to follow, said Amy Turner, senior fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. Dozens of U.S. municipalities already have all-electric building mandates, and lawmakers in some Republican-led states have passed laws blocking cities from imposing such requirements. \"This is going to be the biggest way we can chop off a huge amount of the pollution,\" said Assembly member Emily Gallagher, a Democrat who sponsored an all-electric building bill.',\n",
       "  'The economic fears gripping Wall Street have sparked outsize swings in oil prices, exacerbated by trading that investors and analysts say has little to do with the fundamental value of crude. One culprit is an arcane area of trading known on Wall Street as delta hedging, aimed at reducing the risks tied to directional price moves. This month, oil\\'s steepest weekly slide in almost three years accelerated as futures approached levels where many producers owned derivatives designed to lock in prices. As declines mounted, banks and trading firms on the other side of those trades had to unload crude to mitigate potential losses, investors said, dragging benchmark prices to 15-month lows. Now, many expect similar dynamics could add momentum to any rebound if the economic outlook improves -- leading to more expensive oil that could increase the cost of gasoline and diesel later this year. It is the latest example of how volatility in financial markets can spill into the real world, shaking an oil industry stretching from the shale basins of Texas to refineries in China. The recent retreat \"in many ways had not a lot to do with oil,\" said Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura Group, at an industry confab hosted by the Financial Times last week. \"We got caught up in the macro world again, which happens all the time. It\\'s OK,\" he added. \"But it distorts what happens in the future.\" In the coming week, investors will continue parsing the health of banks along with new readings on home prices, consumer confidence and the Federal Reserve\\'s preferred inflation gauge. A U.S. slowdown would eventually have big implications for crude and other commodities as well as stocks. Delta hedging revolves around a type of derivative known as put options, which are contracts granting their owner the right to sell oil or other investments at a specified price. For oil-and-gas producers such as EQT Corp. and Hess Corp., put options can function like a form of insurance, ensuring they can sell their output at a profit months in advance, even if prices fall. Banks and trading firms get paid premiums to sell puts. But the value of the options can rise -- saddling them with paper losses -- as crude approaches the \"strike\" price of the contracts. Traders can protect themselves either by buying puts of their own or by delta hedging, which in this case entails unloading crude futures. These types of trades can shake up all kinds of markets. When stocks endured bursts of volatility between long periods of calm in the years before the pandemic, some investors blamed hedging with derivatives. During the meme-stock craze, frenetic options trading in shares of companies such as GameStop Corp. and Tesla Inc. led to delta hedging that often amplified price swings in both directions. \"It\\'s not just volatility to the downside,\" said Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at Swiss bank UBS Group. Oil has traded this year within a relatively narrow price range as investors weigh resurgent demand in China against growing recession fears in the U.S. and Europe. Worries about the banking sector fueled a fresh round of selling Friday, sending benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude futures down 1% to $69.26 a barrel. At Hess, which pumps oil from projects including offshore rigs near the coast of Guyana, the hedging strategy includes put options that cover about 65% of the company\\'s projected crude output in 2023, a spokeswoman said. The New York-based company this year has bought contracts covering 80,000 barrels a day of U.S. crude output at $70 a barrel as well as 50,000 barrels a day of Brent, the global price gauge, at $75. \"Just like you have insurance in your home, you hope you never have to use it,\" said Hess Chief Financial Officer John Rielly, speaking at an investor conference this month. Crude prices recently began falling when stocks and bond yields dropped and algorithmic, trend-following trading programs began to sell oil futures, said Pierre Andurand, chief investment officer of Andurand Capital Management. His firm and other funds then sold some of the oil futures they owned to cut potential losses, he added. Options dealers were hedging puts on roughly 80 million barrels of crude oil with strike prices near $70 a barrel when oil dropped toward that level on March 15, according to Standard Chartered. As the possibility grew that financial institutions would need to pay out on those contracts, investors said those trading desks sold futures at an increasingly rapid clip. \"The more you do that, the lower the price goes and the more it pushes other people to do the same thing,\" said Ilia Bouchouev, managing partner at Pentathlon Investments. \"It\\'s a chain reaction.\" The moves accelerated a selloff that pulled the domestic crude benchmark to $66.74 a barrel by the close on March 17, a 13% week-on-week drop that was the sharpest such decline since the pandemic dragged U.S. crude below $0 in April 2020. Eventually, lower prices encouraged some bullish traders as well as oil consumers -- such as airlines -- to step in and buy. That propelled prices higher before Friday\\'s selloff eroded some of the gains. \"A lot of consumers were sitting on dry powder waiting for this move,\" said Brian Murphy, a derivatives broker at Tullett Prebon. Mr. Andurand, whose $1.3 billion hedge fund lost money in the recent rout, said his firm plans to rebuild its bullish position as energy markets stabilize. He is among the traders who think China\\'s appetite for oil will push prices up later this year, even as some analysts suggest that demand outside Asia is sluggish and global supplies are plentiful. Mr. Andurand believes oil prices could reach as high as $140 a barrel later this year. \"Demand will really surprise. . .in a significant way,\" he said.',\n",
       "  'ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance was only a budding oilman when he first set foot in Alaska. Nearly four decades later, his company reigns supreme over the U.S. Arctic. With most of its competitors abandoning the state, ConocoPhillips is forging ahead with drilling there, emboldened by President Biden\\'s approval this month of a robust, new project. At a time when investors profess gloomy views of long-term demand for oil and demand quick returns from companies, Mr. Lance\\'s contrarian strategy sets him apart. The CEO says that a dearth of investments in oil and gas means that the world will need new supplies of crude; as a result, he is pursuing a strategy to drill wells that will yield oil for decades. That plan is underpinned by ConocoPhillips investments in Alaska, where Mr. Lance\\'s career started. He spent around 14 years there navigating the state\\'s energy landscape, politics and, occasionally, its wildlife. An avid hunter and fisherman, Mr. Lance embraced the local lifestyle. The oil boss likes to tell people about the time he was hiking through the Kenai Mountains and crossed paths with a bear that chased him up a tree, said Don Wallette, a former chief financial officer at ConocoPhillips. People who know Mr. Lance said his experience in Alaska shaped his advocacy for the roughly $7 billion Willow project in the state\\'s North Slope, which Mr. Biden greenlighted earlier in March. Willow cements ConocoPhillips\\'s status as the largest producer in the state and gives it license to keep expanding, analysts said. Environmentalists argue Arctic drilling should be halted immediately to avoid a climate catastrophe. The project is expected to yield 180,000 oil barrels a day at its peak. \"These are larger-sized projects because we know the oil is going to be needed for decades,\" Mr. Lance said at the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference this month. While competitors Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. grab more headlines, Houston-based ConocoPhillips under Mr. Lance has quietly become one of the largest Western oil producers. The company\\'s market capitalization, hovering around $118 billion, now exceeds that of British giant BP PLC, which was one of the largest producers in Alaska before selling all of its assets there in 2019. Alaska has been a reliable cash provider for ConocoPhillips. Between 2012 and 2022, the company\\'s business there prospered to represent on average around a quarter of its annual profit, according to a Wall Street Journal review of regulatory filings. Mr. Lance, a Montana native, toiled away on drilling rigs in Wyoming to put himself through college and earn a petroleum engineering degree from Montana Tech University. When he failed to sign up for a job interview with oil company Atlantic Richfield Co., he brought a six-pack of Budweiser to the conference room where the recruiter was camping. He got an interview and nailed it, said Jerry Schuyler, the former recruiter and a confidant to Mr. Lance. Mr. Lance in 1984 joined Arco\\'s Alaska unit -- a company whose assets wound up in ConocoPhillips\\' portfolio. It was a strategic move: Alaska at the time provided roughly a fourth of U.S. crude production. Mr. Lance soon was promoted from a job handling oil field data to one overseeing drill sites -- a task that required interacting with regulatory agencies and legislators in the state, said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Houston-based Pickering Energy Partners and a former Arco engineer in Alaska. \"Ryan got experience being not just a champion of technical projects, but understanding how the system worked,\" he said. Mr. Lance eventually became vice president of Arco\\'s operations in the Western North Slope, part of a region that produces virtually all of Alaska\\'s oil. Phillips Petroleum Co.\\'s acquisition of Arco Alaska in 2000 catapulted him up the corporate ladder. After Phillips merged with Conoco Inc., he was promoted to international roles, before being appointed CEO of the combined entity in 2012. Under Mr. Lance, the company shrank its global presence, in part to prioritize assets generating the highest returns and augment returns to investors. But even as the company shed assets from Algeria to Kazakhstan, it kept nabbing leases and acquiring competitors\\' wells in Alaska. Major oil companies including BP and Shell PLC once also coveted Alaska\\'s oil riches. But regulatory challenges, combined with fruitless exploration efforts and the emergence of shale gushers from North Dakota to Texas refocused some drillers\\' attention away from the remote, capital-intensive Arctic, leaving ConocoPhillips ample room for new business. \"What we\\'re seeing in Alaska is a departure of the bigger companies,\" said Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who has supported Willow. \"Conoco has made a commitment, and they\\'re sticking by it.\" Willow has earned ConocoPhillips scorn from environmental groups, who say the project will emit climate-warming gases for decades. But it has found support among some Alaska Natives\\' associations and the Alaska delegation in Congress. Proponents say Willow could generate local, state and federal revenue of up to $17 billion and create jobs.'],\n",
       " 'Mar 26, 2023': ['Ukrainian officials called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Ukraine\\'s Foreign Ministry, in a written statement released Sunday, said moving the weapons to Belarus would undermine nuclear nonproliferation treaties . \"Ukraine expects effective actions to counter the nuclear blackmail of the Kremlin,\" the statement said, before calling on the other permanent members of the Security Council to intervene. \"We demand to immediately convene an extraordinary meeting of the U.N. Security Council for this purpose.\" Mr. Putin said in remarks published Saturday that Russia would finish building a storage facility for its tactical nuclear weapons—which are designed for battlefield use and aren\\'t large enough to wipe out entire cities—in Belarus by July. The announcement is the latest in a string of steps the Russian president has taken to remind Ukraine—and, more important, its allies—of Moscow\\'s nuclear capabilities . A spokesman for the White House said the administration is closely monitoring the issue but thus far hasn\\'t seen evidence that Mr. Putin had moved nuclear weapons or planned to use them in Ukraine. \"We would agree that no nuclear war should be fought, no nuclear war can be won, clearly that would cross a major threshold,\" John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said Sunday on CBS\\'s \"Face the Nation.\" He said, \"We\\'ve seen nothing that would cause us to change our own strategic deterrent posture.\" Poised to punch back Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko hasn\\'t publicly commented on the announcement, but Mr. Putin told a state television program on Sunday that the Belarusian leader has \"long raised the question of deploying Russian tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus.\" \"There is nothing unusual here either: Firstly, the United States has been doing this for decades,\" Mr. Putin added. \"They have long deployed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allied countries, NATO countries, in Europe.\" North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials rejected a parallel. \"Russia\\'s reference to NATO\\'s nuclear sharing is totally misleading,\" spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said on Twitter. She said NATO countries act in line with their international commitments, while \"Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments.\" Last summer, Mr. Lukashenko said his military\\'s Su-24 warplanes had been modified to carry nuclear weapons, a move that had been agreed upon with Mr. Putin, Belarusian state news agency Belta reported at the time. Western officials and analysts largely played down the significance of the announcement. Moscow has been using Belarus as a launchpad for assaults on Ukraine since the start of the invasion and has already sent Iskander-M missiles, which are nuclear-capable and can deliver a payload of over 500 kilograms to most of Ukraine\\'s territory, into the country. Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who supporters believe rightfully won the country\\'s 2020 presidential vote, said Saturday that Russia\\'s deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus violates the country\\'s constitution and contradicts the will of the Belarusian people to remain a non-nuclear state. \"Russia acts as the occupying force, violating national security and putting Belarus on the collision course with its neighbors and the international community,\" she wrote on Twitter. The German Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, accused Mr. Putin of \"another attempt at nuclear intimidation,\" according to German media. Josep Borrell, the European Union\\'s foreign policy chief, tweeted Sunday that \"Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation and threat to European security.\" He said the EU \"stands ready to respond with further sanctions,\" if Minsk follows this course of action. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said the announcement about stationing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus was part of an information campaign designed to inflame Western fears of nuclear escalation, \"which remains extremely low.\" \"Russia has long fielded nuclear-capable weapons able to strike any target that tactical nuclear weapons based in Belarus could hit,\" the institute wrote. \"Putin is a risk-averse actor who repeatedly threatens to use nuclear weapons without any intention of following through.\" Mr. Putin said Sunday that Russia would on April 3 start training crews to use tactical nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, the United Nations nuclear regulator, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Saturday that its director would again travel to inspect the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear-power plant this week. The visit would be his second since the start of the full-scale invasion last year. \"Despite our presence at the site for seven months now, the situation at the [Zaporizhzhia] Nuclear Power Plant is still precarious,\" the agency\\'s head, Rafael Grossi, said. \"The nuclear safety and security dangers are all too obvious.\" In addition, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Russia was being resupplied with Iranian-made Shahed drones . After a two-week pause in drone attacks in February, Moscow has launched 71 into Ukraine since the start of March. The drone attacks, launched from Russian territory, are \"likely to be a further attempt to stretch Ukrainian air defenses,\" the ministry wrote on Twitter. Meanwhile, Russia continued missile and artillery strikes across much of Ukraine over the weekend. All of the Ukrainian regions that border Russia were hit, as were the partially occupied regions in the south, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. Five civilians were killed and 25 others were injured. Russia\\'s Defense Ministry said Sunday that its troops were undertaking active operations in the areas of Kupyansk, in Ukraine\\'s northeast, Donetsk in the east, and Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south. Though fighting in and around the eastern city of Bakhmut has slowed in recent days, Ukraine\\'s armed forces said Russian forces \"continue to storm the city,\" while also targeting nearby settlements, such as Chasiv Yar, with artillery fire. —Gordon Lubold contributed to this article.',\n",

But it has found support among some Alaska Natives\\' associations, local politicians and the Alaska delegation in Congress. Proponents say that Willow could generate local, state and federal revenue of up to $17 billion and create more than 2,000 construction jobs and 300 permanent jobs. The project almost didn\\'t happen. In 2017, ConocoPhillips said it had found a trove of oil in Alaska\\'s National Petroleum Reserve, a 23-million-acre area managed by the U.S. Interior Department. But a federal judge in 2021 threw out the Bureau of Land Management\\'s approval of the proposed development, dubbed Willow, saying the agency had failed to fully account for the project\\'s environmental impact, and that the agency needed to conduct more studies. Among the options explored by the bureau to reduce Willow\\'s footprint was that its scale be brought down from five drill sites—the company\\'s initial plan—to three. ConocoPhillips made it clear that anything less than three pads wouldn\\'t make the project viable. Mr. Lance made sure the company didn\\'t bend on that point, people close to him said. Last year, as Mr. Lance made the case for Willow in earning calls, ConocoPhillips amped up its lobbying spending. The company shelled out nearly $8.7 million, according to OpenSecrets , a nonpartisan group that tracks political spending—more than what Exxon or Chevron disbursed that year. It listed continued advocacy for Willow among other issues it was lobbying for, according to quarterly lobbying reports. A spokesman for ConocoPhillips said it had increased its engagement with key stakeholders on a range of energy issues and other legislation, including Willow. Ultimately, Mr. Biden gave a down-to-the-wire approval of Willow over fierce objections from environmentalists and many Democrats who wanted the project scuttled. The company was cleared to build three pads. Environmental groups earlier this month sued the Biden administration to stop the project. ConocoPhillips has started building ice roads but agreed to pause some development until a federal judge has reviewed environmentalists\\' request to halt construction activities pending litigation, according to court filings. ConocoPhillips has said it doesn\\'t expect Willow to start churning out oil until around 2029. Those who know Mr. Lance say he believes his strategy will prevail. \"He believes in the long haul, the right answer will usually float to the surface,\" said Mr. Schuyler, the former Arco recruiter.',\n",
       "  'New York is poised to become the first state in the U.S. to pass a law banning natural-gas and other fossil-fuel hookups in new buildings, a step Democrats are pushing to help the state meet targets for greenhouse-gas reduction . The measure is on track to be added to the state\\'s coming budget, which is due to be completed this week. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in January pitched an all-electric building mandate in her spending plan, and both chambers of the Democratic-controlled State Legislature included similar proposals in their respective budget outlines. One of the legislation\\'s most noticeable effects would be an end to gas stoves in new homes, along with other gas-powered appliances such as water heaters, furnaces and clothes dryers. It faces opposition from some Republicans, labor unions, gas companies and business groups, citing concerns including affordability and reliability. Environmental groups have cheered the efforts. Democrats in Albany are still hammering out final details such as when the mandate would take effect, lawmakers said, though all proposals on the table take a phased-in approach. The suggested effective dates tossed around so far, for various kinds of buildings, range from as early as Jan. 1, 2025, to as late as Dec. 31, 2028. The Senate and Assembly measures would exempt uses such as commercial kitchens, hospitals, crematoriums, laboratories and laundromats, while the governor\\'s office said a range of exemptions would be possible. \"The basic premise here is that if you continue to build buildings that are going to require fossil fuels for decades to come, you are baking in…destructive behavior that burning fossil fuels causes,\" said Democratic state Sen. Brian Kavanagh, an advocate in the Senate. \"The first step is to stop digging the hole deeper.\" Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt said the proposals would remove options for consumers. \"Seeking a cleaner energy future does not have to involve outright prohibitions on reliable, affordable energy,\" he said. Controversy over gas stoves flared nationally earlier this year following a news report that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission was considering a gas-stove ban on indoor- air health concerns . Republicans and some centrist Democrats cast the Biden administration as trying to outlaw a beloved way of cooking. The White House said President Biden didn\\'t support a gas-stove ban. New Yorkers for Affordable Energy, a coalition that includes labor unions and gas companies, argues against a mandate, calling it unpopular with residents. A recent Siena College poll found that 53% of all New York respondents said they opposed the idea. \"Natural gas is going to continue to be part of the bridge between what we have now, with the heavy use of fossil fuel, and what we are going to have in the future,\" with more- renewable sources, said Daniel Ortega, of the coalition. \"Unless we are able to address reliability and affordability, none of this is going to work out.\" He cited December\\'s blizzard in Buffalo that caused widespread power outages as an illustration of electricity\\'s limitations. Mr. Kavanagh, who represents lower Manhattan, said the Senate bill allows backup power sources using fossil fuels, and added that modern buildings often have battery-storage capacity. Under New York\\'s proposals for banning fossil-fuel hookups, people who already have gas stoves could keep them. That would also be true under a separate proposal from Ms. Hochul to prohibit the sale of any new fossil-fuel heating equipment and related systems for existing homes and buildings starting in 2030. Passage of a statewide building electrification requirement could spur other states to follow, said Amy Turner, senior fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. \"New York state is a big place. Parts of it are politically purple to red. It has areas of very cold climate,\" she said. Dozens of U.S. municipalities, including many Democratic-led cities in California and elsewhere, already have all-electric building mandates, and lawmakers in some Republican-led states have passed laws blocking cities from imposing such requirements. In late 2021, New York City mandated that most new buildings be constructed fully electric. Some states have pursued similar goals without legislation. Last year the Washington State Building Code Council moved to require heat pumps as the main heating source in buildings. The changes, which take effect in July, allow gas heat pumps and the use of gas supplemental heating. The New York state Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, passed in 2019, calls for a reduction in economywide greenhouse-gas emissions of 40% by 2030 and 85% by 2050 from 1990 levels. \"This is going to be the biggest way we can chop off a huge amount of the pollution,\" said Assembly member Emily Gallagher, a Democrat who sponsored an all-electric building bill.',\n",
       "  'The economic fears gripping Wall Street have sparked outsize swings in oil prices, exacerbated by trading that investors and analysts say has little to do with the fundamental value of crude. One culprit is an arcane area of trading known on Wall Street as delta hedging, aimed at reducing the risks tied to directional price moves. Earlier this month, oil\\'s steepest weekly slide in almost three years accelerated as futures approached levels where many producers owned derivatives designed to lock in prices. As declines mounted, banks and trading firms on the other side of those trades had to unload crude to mitigate potential losses, investors said, dragging benchmark prices to 15-month lows. Now, many expect similar dynamics could add momentum to any rebound if the economic outlook improves—leading to more expensive oil that could increase the cost of gasoline and diesel later this year. It is the latest example of how volatility in financial markets can spill into the real world, shaking an oil industry stretching from the shale basins of Texas to refineries in China. The recent retreat \"in many ways had not a lot to do with oil,\" said Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura Group, at an industry confab hosted by the Financial Times last week. \"We got caught up in the macro world again, which happens all the time. It\\'s OK,\" he added. \"But it distorts what happens in the future.\" In the coming week, investors will continue parsing the health of banks, along with new readings on home prices, consumer confidence and the Federal Reserve\\'s preferred inflation gauge. A U.S. slowdown would eventually have big implications for crude and other commodities, as well as stocks. Delta hedging revolves around a type of derivative known as put options, which are contracts granting their owner the right to sell oil or other investments at a specified price. For oil-and-gas producers such as EQT Corp. and Hess Corp., put options can function like a form of insurance, ensuring they can sell their output at a profit months in advance, even if prices fall. Banks and trading firms get paid premiums to sell puts. But the value of the options can rise—saddling them with paper losses—as crude approaches the \"strike\" price of the contracts. Traders can protect themselves either by buying puts of their own, or by delta hedging, which in this case entails unloading crude futures. These types of trades can shake up all kinds of markets. When stocks endured bursts of volatility between long periods of calm in the years before the pandemic, some investors said hedging with derivatives was to blame . During the meme-stock craze, frenetic options trading in shares of companies such as GameStop Corp. and Tesla Inc. led to delta hedging that often amplified price swings in both directions. \"It\\'s not just volatility to the downside,\" said Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at Swiss bank UBS Group. Oil has traded this year within a relatively narrow price range as investors weigh resurgent demand in China against growing recession fears in the U.S. and Europe. Worries about the banking sector fueled a fresh round of selling Friday, sending benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude futures down 1% to $69.26 a barrel. At Hess, which pumps oil from projects including offshore rigs near the coast of Guyana, the hedging strategy includes put options that cover about 65% of the company\\'s projected crude output in 2023, a spokeswoman said. The New York-based company this year has bought contracts covering 80,000 barrels a day of U.S. crude output at $70 a barrel, as well as 50,000 barrels a day of Brent, the global price gauge, at $75. \"Just like you have insurance in your home, you hope you never have to use it,\" said Hess Chief Financial Officer John Rielly, speaking at an investor conference this month. Crude prices recently began falling when stocks and bond yields dropped and algorithmic, trend-following trading programs began to sell oil futures, said Pierre Andurand, chief investment officer of Andurand Capital Management. His firm and other funds then sold some of the oil futures they owned to cut potential losses, he added. Options dealers were hedging puts on roughly 80 million barrels of crude oil with strike prices near $70 a barrel when oil dropped toward that level on March 15, according to Standard Chartered. As the possibility grew that financial institutions would need to pay out on those contracts, investors said those trading desks sold futures at an increasingly rapid clip. \"The more you do that, the lower the price goes and the more it pushes other people to do the same thing,\" said Ilia Bouchouev, managing partner at Pentathlon Investments. \"It\\'s a chain reaction.\" The moves accelerated a selloff that pulled the domestic crude benchmark to $66.74 a barrel by the close on March 17, a 13% week-on-week drop that was the sharpest such decline since the pandemic dragged U.S. crude below $0 in April 2020 . Eventually, lower prices encouraged some bullish traders as well as oil consumers—such as airlines—to step in and buy. That propelled prices higher before Friday\\'s selloff eroded some of the gains. \"A lot of consumers were sitting on dry powder waiting for this move,\" said Brian Murphy, a derivatives broker at Tullett Prebon. Mr. Andurand, whose $1.3 billion hedge fund lost money in the recent rout, said his firm plans to rebuild its bullish position as energy markets stabilize. He is among the traders who think China\\'s appetite for oil will push prices up later this year, even as some analysts suggest that demand outside Asia is sluggish and global supplies are plentiful. Chinese refiners have recently snapped up supertanker shipments of oil in a sign that China\\'s long-awaited recovery from pandemic lockdowns is finally beginning to take hold. Citing mobility data in China and the restart of international flights in and out of the country, Mr. Andurand believes oil prices could reach as high as $140 a barrel later this year. \"Demand will really surprise…in a significant way,\" he said.',\n",
       "  'The United Auto Workers elected reform candidate Shawn Fain as its next leader, marking an upheaval in the union\\'s top ranks and creating a wild card for auto makers ahead of contract talks in Detroit. Mr. Fain, a 54-year-old who started his career as an electrician and rose through the UAW ranks while working at factories now owned by Stellantis NV, has struck a more strident tone ahead of negotiations later this year. His reform group has vowed to not give any concessions to the car companies and raised the possibility of a strike when contracts expire this fall. \"Today we put the companies on notice. The fighting UAW is back,\" Mr. Fain said in a video address after his victory. Mr. Fain declared victory on Saturday, narrowly defeating incumbent Ray Curry, who issued a statement saying Mr. Fain would be sworn in as president on Sunday. It is the first time in more than 70 years that a challenger defeated a presidential candidate from the UAW\\'s longtime ruling party. The office of the federal monitor overseeing the election filed the final tally to a U.S. District Court in Michigan on Saturday. Those results, which had Mr. Fain winning 69,459 to 68,976, aren\\'t considered certified until all election-related challenges are resolved. The election of Mr. Fain is a turning point for the UAW, which represents more than 400,000 workers in the automotive sector and other industries and is emerging from a yearslong corruption scandal . His campaign vowed to root out any residual corruption, while also taking the toughest stance against auto makers of any union leadership since the 1940s. \"This election was not just a race between two candidates, it was a referendum on the direction of the UAW,\" Mr. Fain said in a statement. The UAW represents roughly 145,000 hourly members at U.S. factories owned by General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Ram, Chrysler and other U.S.-sold brands. The coming negotiations, which occur every four years, are set to begin this summer ahead of the expiration of the current labor contracts in September. Mr. Fain\\'s victory heightens the chance of a UAW strike at one of the auto makers, Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan wrote in a recent research note. \"The new reform candidates have less national bargaining experience and are promising an aggressive stance,\" he said. This year\\'s round of collective bargaining was already setting up to be particularly contentious, with potential flashpoints over wages, high inflation and job security as the auto makers switch to electric vehicles . Meanwhile, the companies are in belt-tightening mode. GM recently said it plans to cut $2 billion in costs by next year and this month offered voluntary buyouts to most of its roughly 58,000 white-collar U.S. workers. Ford cut about 3,000 white-collar jobs and contract positions last year. The union vote resulted from a shift in the way the UAW selects top officials. Historically, leaders of the union\\'s local chapters elected the UAW\\'s top officers. In late 2021, the union\\'s rank-and-file voted to change the election procedure to allow members to directly cast ballots to pick their leaders. The vote on the election change was required under terms of a civil settlement between the Justice Department and the UAW in 2020, following a multiyear federal investigation that led to the convictions of more than a dozen top UAW officials, including two former presidents . The corruption scandal eroded members\\' trust in the UAW\\'s leadership, factory workers have said, and provided momentum to Mr. Fain and his reform group. Federal prosecutors, in filing charges against prior union leaders, described a culture of corruption that included kickback schemes, embezzlement and other illicit activities. Under terms of the settlement, a federal monitor oversees the union\\'s finances and other activities, including the recent election. Mr. Fain and the other candidates on his reform-minded UAW Members United slate have said they want to unify a divided membership, ensure equal pay and benefits for workers at varying levels of the union and increase the value of retirees\\' pensions. \"The UAW officers, the people elected to lead and serve this great union have taken bribes, stolen dues and betrayed the trust of the membership. That ends here,\" Mr. Fain said in the Saturday video address. Mr. Fain faces a divided executive board, about half of which is filled by his caucus. The broader membership, too, is divided, based on Mr. Fain\\'s narrow victory margin, said Marick Masters, a professor of business with a focus on labor at Wayne State University in Detroit. \"You have an opportunity now to see the extent to which rank-and-file may be dissatisfied with the current leadership,\" he said. Mr. Fain has been involved in contract negotiations both at the national level and at Chrysler Corp. factories, now owned by Stellantis, according to his group\\'s website.

       " 'Mar 25, 2023': ['The United Auto Workers elected reform candidate Shawn Fain as its next leader, according to Mr. Fain and his opponent, marking an upheaval in the union\\'s top ranks and creating a wild card for auto makers ahead of contract talks in Detroit. Mr. Fain, a 54-year-old who started his career as an electrician and rose through the UAW ranks while working at factories now owned by Stellantis NV, has struck a more strident tone ahead of negotiations later this year. His reform group has vowed to not give any concessions to the car companies and raised the possibility of a strike when contracts expire this fall. Mr. Fain declared victory on Saturday, narrowly defeating incumbent Ray Curry, who issued a statement saying Mr. Fain would be sworn in as president on Sunday. It is the first time in more than 70 years that a challenger defeated a presidential candidate from the UAW\\'s longtime ruling party. The office of the federal monitor overseeing the election filed the final tally to a U.S. District Court in Michigan on Saturday. Those results, which had Mr. Fain winning 69,459 to 68,976, aren\\'t considered certified until all election-related challenges are resolved. The election of Mr. Fain is a turning point for the UAW, which represents more than 400,000 workers in the automotive sector and other industries and is emerging from a yearslong corruption scandal . His campaign vowed to root out any residual corruption, while also taking the toughest stance against auto makers of any union leadership since the 1940s. \"Everything we do, at every stage, must be reinforcing the message: there is a new sheriff in town,\" said a draft transition-plan document from early February that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal and verified by the Fain campaign. The UAW represents roughly 145,000 hourly members at U.S. factories owned by General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Ram, Chrysler and other U.S.-sold brands. The coming negotiations, which occur every four years, are set to begin this summer ahead of the expiration of the current labor contracts in September. Mr. Fain\\'s victory heightens the chance of a UAW strike at one of the auto makers, Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan wrote in a recent research note. \"The new reform candidates have less national bargaining experience and are promising an aggressive stance,\" he said. In a statement sent earlier this week, the Fain campaign said: \"We need to take a new approach to the companies, and a new approach to how our union operates.\" This year\\'s round of collective bargaining was already setting up to be particularly contentious, with potential flashpoints over wages, high inflation and job security as the auto makers switch to electric vehicles . Meanwhile, the companies are in belt-tightening mode. GM recently said it plans to cut $2 billion in costs by next year and this month offered voluntary buyouts to most of its roughly 58,000 white-collar U.S. workers. Ford cut about 3,000 white-collar jobs and contract positions last year. The union vote resulted from a shift in the way the UAW selects top officials. Historically, leaders of the union\\'s local chapters elected the UAW\\'s top officers. In late 2021, the union\\'s rank-and-file voted to change the election procedure to allow members to directly cast ballots to pick their leaders. The vote on the election change was required under terms of a civil settlement between the Justice Department and the UAW in 2020, following a multiyear federal investigation that led to the convictions of more than a dozen top UAW officials, including two former presidents . The corruption scandal eroded members\\' trust in the UAW\\'s leadership, factory workers have said, and provided momentum to Mr. Fain and his reform group. Federal prosecutors, in filing charges against prior union leaders, described a culture of corruption that included kickback schemes, embezzlement and other illicit activities. Under terms of the settlement, a federal monitor oversees the union\\'s finances and other activities, including the recent election. Mr. Fain and the other candidates on his reform-minded UAW Members United slate have said they want to unify a divided membership, ensure equal pay and benefits for workers at varying levels of the union and increase the value of retirees\\' pensions. Mr. Fain faces a divided executive board, about half of which is filled by his caucus. The broader membership, too, is divided, based on Mr. Fain\\'s narrow victory margin, said Marick Masters, a professor of business with a focus on labor at Wayne State University in Detroit. \"You have an opportunity now to see the extent to which rank-and-file may be dissatisfied with the current leadership,\" he said. Mr. Fain has been involved in contract negotiations both at the national level and at Chrysler Corp. factories, now owned by Stellantis, according to his group\\'s website. As the auto industry develops more electric vehicles, which are less labor-intensive to produce than internal-combustion-engine cars, preserving manufacturing jobs in gas-engine plants will be a focus of the UAW, leaders have said.

       "  'TEHRAN—Iran\\'s move to reset diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia was a radical break from years of enmity between the two Middle East rivals, but it hasn\\'t been enough to prop up its struggling economy. Before China stepped in to broker the deal earlier this month, Iran\\'s currency, the rial , had lost a fifth of its value over the last two weeks of February to hit a record low, adding to the problems besetting the ruling clerics here. Inflation was already rising, hitting 59% late last year, and talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal and get some relief from U.S. sanctions were all but dead. European powers had given up on a separate mechanism to transfer funds to Iran for humanitarian aid. Prisoner-swap negotiations with the U.S. weren\\'t progressing either, keeping billions of dollars in overseas bank accounts out of reach. The Americans had also begun cracking down on flows of hard currency from neighboring Iraq , removing an important pressure valve. \"The economic situation is a major part of why right now the Iranians decided to make this de-escalation agreement with the Saudis,\" said Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at Washington\\'s Middle East Institute. But while news of the deal helped ease the strain on the rial in the short term, pushing it off its historic low of more than 600,000 to the dollar, the currency has since lost value as the reality sinks in that, even with the Saudi deal, the country has few prospects for a turnaround unless it can escape sanctions over its nuclear program or build closer economic ties with China and Russia. \"It\\'s a thin market that lives and dies on headlines—and the headlines have been good the past few weeks,\" said Henry Rome, a senior fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. But, he said, \"inflation, especially food, is very high and rising, and the government is doing little to reel it in.\" The approach of Nowruz—the two-week Persian New Year holiday that began Monday—was a flashpoint. Middle-class Iranians found themselves with much diminished purchasing power for the rice, meat and other ingredients for the holiday\\'s feasts, and retired teachers, social-security officials and military personnel were protesting economic conditions across the country. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged the scope of the problems in a speech Tuesday marking Nowruz. \"If, God willing, we are able to reduce the economic problems and if, God willing, our officials make an effort, practice diligence and work hard on important tasks in this field, many of the country\\'s other problems will also be solved,\" Mr. Khamenei said, according to the state-run news agency IRNA. Iran\\'s clerical leaders have promised to tackle inflation before without success. When Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi took office in 2021 he vowed to reduce inflation to below 15% in 2023 and to single digits in 2024, but prices have only escalated, raising pressure on the government. Inflation remains rampant at more than 50%, with the cost of meat rising by 90% over the past year, according to the semiofficial ISNA news agency. When reformist newspaper Sazandegi reported about rising anger about food prices with a dramatic front-page headline, \"Meat Rebellion,\" on Feb. 20, it was immediately shut down. Ordinary Iranians say they have had trouble affording the ingredients to prepare Nowruz meals this week. \"We have become numb against inflation,\" said Alireza Babaie, a home-appliances salesman. \"We don\\'t feel anything anymore.\" Economists and traders say Saudi Arabia and Iran\\'s other neighbors are unlikely to pour significant amounts of cash into the Islamic Republic despite Tehran\\'s restoring diplomatic ties with Riyadh. Western sanctions remain a powerful deterrent. They also say Saudi Arabia would want to see if Tehran holds up its end of the deal by halting covert weapons shipments to its Houthi allies in Yemen , where Iran and Saudi Arabia had been fighting a proxy war. The resumption of diplomatic relations would help broaden political and economic cooperation in the region, Iranian Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said after the China-brokered deal was signed. There are some positive signs for Iran, chiefly its growing involvement with China, which increasingly is positioning itself as a global diplomatic counterpoint to the U.S. Beijing\\'s role in facilitating the deal between the two Middle East rivals signals that it intends to continue buying oil from both Saudi Arabia and Iran, ensuring Tehran a continuing economic lifeline, said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, chief executive officer of Bourse and Bazaar, a London-based think tank that studies the Iranian economy. Iran also has a growing military relationship with Russia, supplying drones for use in its war in Ukraine , and it is trying to expand other trade flows with Moscow. It is also negotiating with the West to retrieve some oil-revenue funds locked in countries such as South Korea, though with little success. Besides these relationships and the improvement in the relationship with Saudi Arabia, Iran has few other options to alleviate its problems and improve the prospects for its 88 million people. In January, the World Bank predicted its economy would grow 2.2% this year and by 1.9% in 2024—less than it needs to put it back on a sustainable long-term growth track. Crucially, the government is now finding it harder to maintain subsidies for food and energy and can\\'t afford to increase wages for civil servants. \"Tehran doesn\\'t have a lot of financial firepower to try to address these problems,\" Mr. Batmanghelidj said. Nor will closer ties to heavyweights such as China and Saudi Arabia make up for years of mismanagement and sanctions, said Mostafa Pakzad, a Tehran-based adviser to foreign companies. \"The Saudi deal releases a bit of oxygen for the regime not to suffocate,\" he said.',\n",
       "  'HARSEWINKEL, Germany—When Russia invaded Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin was counting on soaring energy prices and falling confidence to sink European companies, undermining the West\\'s support for Kyiv. One year on, many European companies have overcome the blow after slashing energy use and pivoting to a friendly and booming U.S. market. Such resilience has helped shore up political and popular support in Europe for Ukraine. Nowhere has the dynamic surprised as much as in Germany, a hub for energy-hungry manufacturers that had long relied on cheap supplies of Russian natural gas . Not only have German companies avoided the crash many economists predicted, but Berlin has also turned from relatively Kremlin-friendly into Kyiv\\'s third-biggest arms supplier. One of these companies is Claas KGaA mbH, a manufacturer of agricultural machinery with 5 billion euros of annual revenue, the equivalent of around $5.4 billion, and about 12,000 employees. When Moscow\\'s troops marched into Ukraine, Claas made about one quarter of its total sales in Central and Eastern Europe, including Russia. It has a large sales office in Ukraine and a plant in the Russian city of Krasnodar, 150 miles east of Crimea. Yet instead of retrenching, it cut production in Russia and China while increasing output at its main German factory by 30% last year. It reduced natural-gas consumption by almost one-third by making technical changes and has pivoted sales from Russia to the Americas. \"You look at what people and technical facilities you can use, and then you solve the problem,\" said Kai Gieselmann, a factory manager at Claas\\'s headquarters. Claas reported a 3% increase in annual output last year to almost €5 billion and a smaller but healthy profit. A 6% decline in sales in Central and Eastern Europe including Russia was more than offset by sales growth of 35% in the Americas. The changes wrought by Russia\\'s war \"won\\'t go away. One lesson is that we are somewhat maneuvering into a new normal,\" said Claas Chief Executive Thomas Böck. Claas\\'s pivot started on the morning of Russia\\'s invasion, on Feb. 24, 2022. That day, Mr. Böck was woken at 4 a.m. by a call from one of his managers. \"People were really under attack, you could hear bombs falling, on the phone,\" he said. His immediate problem was to reshuffle operations in Ukraine and Russia. The company\\'s top officials assembled in offices adjacent to its factory in the West German town of Harsewinkel, known officially as \"combine harvester city.\" Claas sourced key parts in Russia and Ukraine, including gears and large metal components. Executives fretted about whether they would be able to receive payments from Russia and if they would have enough cash to shore up their supply chain. Then as Moscow began throttling natural-gas supplies to Europe came another question: \"What does this mean for energy?\" said Henner Böttcher, the company\\'s chief financial officer. Claas executives said they used game theory to figure out how Berlin would ration fuel that millions of households rely on for heating—if it came to that—and figured that the company wouldn\\'t be shut off because of its proximity to Europe\\'s gas hub in the Netherlands. Still, the executives had to develop a contingency plan that would allow the company to survive a 30% decline in gas supplies. At its core was the decision to refit furnaces and heating systems so that they could run on oil as well as gas, including by installing new pipes. To keep the refitted furnaces humming, Claas bought and stored two million liters of oil on site. It also spent €300,000 to build liquefied-petroleum gas tanks and signed a supply contract for LPG delivery, which arrives by truck from the Netherlands. As gas prices surged to almost 20 times their 2021 levels, energy-hungry producers of critical components were coming under pressure across Germany, reducing production. For Claas, that created shortages of products such as gearboxes and rubber tractor tires, which compounded pandemic-era bottlenecks for components like microchips. The company developed software to keep abreast of problems at its hundreds of suppliers, using data to make long-term forecasts about where shortages might emerge. Senior managers meet daily on the factory floor, at 9:45 a.m., to check on supplies and identify potential bottlenecks, said Mr. Gieselmann. \"There are 240,000 parts in the combine harvester and I feel like I know every one,\" said Mr. Böttcher. His supplies task force meets at 7 a.m. every day, with procurement managers looking at how many parts are missing. To cut its energy bill, the company made simple changes—switching lightbulbs for LEDs, turning down the heating and eliminating warm water in some washrooms, plus some more complex ones. Workers in Claas\\'s paint shop found a way to lower the temperature of treating metals before they are painted by changing the chemicals in the vats. That reduced the temperature needed for the process from 95 degrees Fahrenheit to 68 degrees, room temperature. On the factory floor, three energy scouts constantly look for new ways to curb use. Digital counters around the factory show how much energy is being consumed. Employees are motivated to find small savings by being rewarded with a share of the money. One recent suggestion: Two similar metal parts were adapted so that only one part would be needed. A machine now recycles heat from the bench where combines\\' engines are tested, and uses it to heat the air in the factory. That saves 90% of energy costs in that step of the production process. Compounded across Germany, such efforts added up, slashing the country\\'s energy consumption by around one-quarter, according to data by the German energy regulator. To address parts shortages, Claas managers stepped into the market directly to support smaller suppliers, using the company\\'s clout as a big customer or tapping its contact books to source parts such as microchips. Sometimes, these effort involved resorting to unconventional fixes. Claas welded parts for one Dutch supplier at its German factory before shipping them back to the Netherlands. Its board members flew around the world to twist arms and loosen supply-chain blockages. One purchasing manager snapped up parts for a supplier on his personal credit card at the weekend. \"Everything is based on a long-term relationship,\" said Mr. Böck. One of the biggest consequences of the Ukraine war for Claas was the redrawing of its global client map. The company still operates its Russian plant—combine harvesters are exempt from sanctions, it says—but has written off its investment there, valued at €40 million. As they scoured for alternative markets last year, executives settled on the Americas and especially the booming U.S. market. \"The market was there and the money was there,\" Mr. Böck said. U.S. farmers could still benefit from Trump administration subsidies, while the strong dollar allowed Claas to offer low prices compared with local competitors, a spokesman said. Claas has a factory in Omaha, Neb., and its largest combine harvester model, the Lexion, won the \"Coolest German Thing Made in the U.S.A.\" Award in October, presented by the German-American Chambers of Commerce. Claas\\'s global supply chain also looks very different from a year ago. The company moved processes such as welding out of China and back to Harsewinkel. Economists say a number of German businesses have reshored production from China to Germany in recent years, in part to avoid U.S. tariffs, while others have transferred assets to countries politically allied with the West in a practice often referred to as friendshoring. Instead of Russia, Claas now buys parts for combine harvesters and telescopic handlers, which are similar to forklifts, in Eastern Europe and Germany, and large pre-assembled metal components in the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania. Claas\\'s German factories still run mostly on gas, but it is sourced from friendly countries such as the U.K. and Norway. Wholesale gas prices appear to be settling at about double the average level over the last decade and are expected to remain higher than other regions such as the U.S. Despite all the changes, Claas wasn\\'t left entirely unscathed. Some of its processes are now costlier, which has eaten into its profitability and dented its competitiveness, executives say. Mr. Böttcher, the CFO, said the company now has significantly lower margins than competitors in the U.S. and Japan. \"The export model is robust, but in a different form,\" said Mr. Böck, the CEO. The lesson of the past few years, he says: \"Don\\'t be dependent on one country.\"',\n",
       "  'Manipulation of earnings from Corporate America is on the rise, an ominous omen for the U.S. economy. That is the conclusion of new research on accounting fraud, using a technique that flagged Enron as an earnings manipulator several years before the energy company\\'s spectacular 2001 implosion. Unless you study accounting, you have likely never come across the M-Score, which is the number underlying both the Enron episode and the economywide concern now. The \"M\" is for manipulation, and uses a company\\'s financial statements to determine whether it is engaging in manipulation. Since the 1990s, the metric has been used to identify red flags at individual companies. Now Messod D. Beneish, a professor of accounting at Indiana University who developed the M-Score in the 1990s, and several co-authors have calculated an aggregate score for nearly 2,000 companies. It shows a disturbing pattern in the historical data: The probability of manipulation usually rises rapidly in the quarters before the economy tips into recession. \"We think this is a measure of misinformation in the economy,\" said Dr. Beneish. The new aggregate measure was published in a December paper, and the latest data -- compiled in March and shared with The Wall Street Journal -- shows that the collective probability of fraud across major companies is the highest in over 40 years. The M-Score is calculated from eight ratios on a company\\'s balance sheet, all numbers that public companies report quarterly, and comparing the ratios to earnings statements from a year earlier. For example, one of the eight metrics raises a flag if a company abruptly starts reporting more \"receivables,\" that is, more money owed to the firm but not yet paid. Another flag goes up if a company reports higher values of assets that cannot be sold, and that aren\\'t clearly identified as plants, property or equipment. A third looks at changes in accruals, which is when an expense has been incurred, but not yet paid. Another identifies whether companies change how much depreciation they take. There are ways for companies to manipulate all these metrics to appear profitable even when actual sales aren\\'t improving. Of course, there could be legitimate reasons for any of these. A customer might have placed a large order toward the end of the quarter, yet won\\'t pay until early in the next quarter. A drug company might have purchased a major patent, which isn\\'t easily sold. It isn\\'t a factory, but it is genuinely very valuable. But collectively, if these metrics are moving in the wrong direction, it suggests funny business. The M-Score\\'s most famous moment came when it was revealed that three years before Enron\\'s collapse, a group of students at Cornell University\\'s business school, under accounting professor Charles Lee, used Dr. Beneish\\'s model to flag that Enron \"may be a company manipulating its earnings.\" Though their report was posted online, it received little attention until after Enron\\'s collapse. The model also flagged the German payment-processor Wirecard AG. Its spectacular collapse after accounting fraud was exposed in 2020 drew comparisons with Enron. Dr. Lee, now a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, says that any of the eight metrics wouldn\\'t necessarily mean trouble. But when the score of the combined metrics is rising, it shows \"a growth company, with core businesses that are eroding, that is running out of economic steam and using aggressive accounting,\" he said. Even if the accounting is legitimate, he added, \"you may want to avoid that company.\" Similar scores have been popular in accounting since the late 1960s. There is the Altman Z-score, created in 1968 by Edward Altman, for predicting whether companies are at risk of bankruptcy, and the Dechow F-Score, from the University of Southern California\\'s Patricia Dechow, designed to predict accounting misstatements. Models such as the M-Score aren\\'t necessarily smoking guns. They will sometimes flag legitimate businesses, especially with mergers and acquisitions. Strange shifts occur when companies absorb each other. They are, though, a reason to look more closely. \"You cannot take it to court and say, \\'Look, this company has a big M-Score and must be a fraud,\\'\" said Dr. Lee. \"But statistically, this fits the profile of a manipulator.\" In aggregate, when more firms are reporting sales that haven\\'t actually been completed, declining asset quality or any of the other indicators, it likely indicates that something in the economy is beginning to go wrong. And there is no shortage of signs of strain in the economy right now. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, several high-profile banks have collapsed, manufacturing activity has slowed and home prices are declining. Still, there is reason to think that the M-Score has something to add to the traditional numbers used to take stock of economic activity. False information on balance sheets has \"real economic effects because it represents misinformation on which firms base their investment, hiring, and production decisions,\" Dr. Beneish and his co-authors -- David Farber of Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis and Matthew Glendening and Kenneth Shaw, both of the University of Missouri -- wrote in December. The theory is that their index might be catching distress in the stages when some companies are taking steps to try to cover it up. That is when conditions on the ground are beginning to deteriorate, but firms are continuing to report strong earnings. The stock market might behave like the corporate sector is still humming along when in reality, its earnings are increasingly buoyed by tricks. The scholars\\' aggregate index is too new to have much of a record. Financial history is littered with recession predictors that worked great using historical data that promptly failed when used to predict the future. It didn\\'t work \"out of sample,\" as statisticians would say. So, it remains to be seen how useful the aggregate M-Score will be. But if there are a lot of things on balance sheets right now that look like fraud, that is probably not a great thing.',\n",
       "  'OTTAWA -- President Biden, making his first trip as president to Canada, said a robust U.S. industrial policy based on producing clean technology, electric vehicles and semiconductors would benefit workers on both sides of the northern border as he joined with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Mr. Biden used an address to the Canadian Parliament to promote their commitment to defending Ukraine, and possibilities for workers through the new healthcare and climate-change law called the Inflation Reduction Act, and another law to promote semiconductor manufacturing. \"We must never doubt our capacity for Canada and the United States to do big things, to stand together. . . . We\\'re going to write the future together,\" he said. The two leaders have maintained warm personal ties, going back to Mr. Biden\\'s time as vice president, and the two sides planned to confer on a range of defense, economic and migration issues. Mr. Trudeau said the two nations are coordinating during \"serious times,\" citing the \"consequences of a warming planet\" that are \"intersecting with the aftermath of a global pandemic.\" He said the passage of Mr. Biden\\'s legislation would mean \"clients for Canadian critical minerals processors, for our clean energy innovators, for our integrated auto workers, for our farmers, growers and producers and so many others.\" The Inflation Reduction Act offers extensive tax credits and other support for clean-energy projects. The incentives have sparked a flood of investments in the U.S., and to Canada. As part of the meetings, the U.S. and Canada reached an deal that would allow both countries to turn back asylum seekers who unlawfully cross the northern border, which has seen an influx in crossings between New York and Quebec. Under the agreement, which begins Saturday, Canada would provide 15,000 slots for migrants to enter legally over the next year on a humanitarian basis from the Western Hemisphere. The meetings in the Canadian capital followed Chinese President Xi Jinping\\'s talks this week in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Messrs. Biden and Trudeau have been staunch allies of Ukraine, and the White House expressed skepticism about China\\'s interest in negotiating a cease-fire in Ukraine, saying it would provide Russian forces with an opportunity to regroup. \"We\\'ve stood together to defend sovereignty, to defend democracy,\" Mr. Biden said. The U.S. and Canada \"must stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine with as much as it takes, for as long as it takes,\" Mr. Trudeau said. On defense, Canada unveiled a timetable on spending plans to upgrade its defense capability in the Arctic, to track and detect threats from Russia and China. U.S. officials pushed Canada to accelerate spending plans, and issue firm commitments on funding sources. Canada said some of the new detection systems could start operating in 2028.',\n",
       "  'BROWNSVILLE, Texas -- Some 1,000 trucks a day arrive from Mexico at a border checkpoint here near the southern tip of Texas. Their first stop is a white-and-yellow painted metal portal where energy beamed at the trucks produces X-ray images to try to spot fentanyl and other contraband. Such scrutiny is rare. Across the southern border, most U.S.-bound trucks and nearly all passenger vehicles are generally scanned selectively if they are pulled aside. Mexican cartels have long profited from these odds while smuggling fentanyl and other narcotics. Their illicit trade propelled the U.S. to a record of nearly 107,000 fatal overdoses in 2021, the most recent year of full data. The U.S. wants to increase routine scanning to try to stanch this flow. President Biden called for more drug-detection technology in last month\\'s State of the Union speech and this month\\'s budget proposal, which included $305 million for new inspection systems, including the technology used in Brownsville. Mexican cartels are the main source of fentanyl, producing it in makeshift labs with Chinese chemicals, according to U.S. law-enforcement authorities. Though cartels have many ways to smuggle in drugs -- from mailed packages to secret tunnels and pedestrian couriers -- authorities said fentanyl is most often hidden in cars and trucks and driven through border checkpoints. \"They\\'re just blitzing the country through the ports of entry,\" said Derek Maltz, a retired Drug Enforcement Administration official who spent 28 years in the agency. The scanners in Brownsville beam energy at a truck in varying levels of intensity. Beaming less energy at the cab allows drivers to stay inside, speeding the process. Directing more energy at the trailer produces an image of the truck that officials can use to spot suspect material within. Sometimes the payload is illicit drugs including fentanyl. Fentanyl\\'s properties make it ideal for smuggling, drug-enforcement experts said. Cars and trucks make more than 200,000 trips across the southern border into the U.S. every day.\"The sheer volume is one of the biggest challenges that we have,\" said Jody Hardin, executive director for planning program analysis and evaluation at U.S. Customs and Border Protection\\'s Office of Field Operations. The explosive opioid problem and violent cartel crime have heightened tensions between the U.S. and Mexico. Just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, in the city of Matamoros, gunmen from a local cartel in March kidnapped four Americans, killing two. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has denied that fentanyl is produced in Mexico while touting renewed cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico in attempts to stop the synthetic opioid from flowing north. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas visited Nogales, Ariz., on March 21 to announce busts following a law-enforcement operation aimed at fentanyl trafficking. Through the first five months of the fiscal year that began in October, CBP said it seized about 11,000 pounds of drugs identified as fentanyl. This is nearly as much as was seized in the full 2021 fiscal year and approaches the 14,700 pounds seized in fiscal 2022. Mr. Mayorkas said the new law-enforcement operation netted some 1,700 pounds of drugs identified as fentanyl, methamphetamine and cocaine. Customs officials want to perform more of what they call nonintrusive inspections, which includes the multi-energy portals on display in Brownsville, to increase the efficiency of processing the huge volume of vehicles arriving daily. \"At the onset we saw a drastic increase in narcotics seizures,\" said Tater Ortiz, who directs the Brownsville port of entry. But a string of busts was followed by a plunge in confiscations as smugglers went elsewhere, he said. The U.S. aims to deploy 123 large-scale scanners along the border by fiscal 2026, growing its ability to perform nonintrusive scans to 70% of cargo vehicles and 40% of passenger vehicles, according to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Historically, the U.S. has performed such scans on only 17% of cargo vehicles and 2% of passenger vehicles, the office said. Adding more scanning technology has to be part of an effort that includes trying to reduce drug demand and the odds overdoses will prove fatal, said David Luckey, a senior Rand Corp. researcher. \"There\\'s no silver bullet,\" he said. Outside Culiacan, home to the Sinaloa Cartel, the operator of a fentanyl lab and counterfeit pill factory said he isn\\'t bothered by the prospect of new technology. \"They don\\'t stop all the cars,\" he said. \"There are lots of ways.\" He said the price of fentanyl has fallen in recent months from about $5,000 per kilogram to $3,500 per kilogram as more people get into the business. At the Brownsville bridge, tractor-trailer trucks line up each day in lanes for their scans.

       "  'SINGAPORE -- China\\'s Foreign Ministry criticized the U.S. for targeting TikTok and said Beijing would never require companies to illegally gather data and intelligence from overseas, escalating the debate over the popular app. The U.S. has presumed TikTok\\'s guilt and unreasonably suppressed the app, even though the government has provided no evidence that TikTok threatens its national security, Mao Ning, a ministry spokeswoman, said Friday. \"The Chinese government has never asked and will never ask any company or individual to collect or provide data, information or intelligence located in other countries through means that are in violation of local laws,\" she said. The remarks came a day after lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee hammered TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew in a five-hour hearing Thursday. Swelling bipartisan skepticism after the hearing could cloud the app\\'s future in its most lucrative market.',\n",
       "  'SEOUL -- South Korea\\'s LG Energy Solution Ltd. said it would invest about $5.6 billion in a battery-manufacturing complex in Arizona, the latest in a string of new plants by foreign companies as the U.S. transitions toward cleaner fuels. LG Energy said Friday that the new battery complex in Queen Creek, Ariz., would mainly serve electric-vehicle makers in North America. The amount is about four times as large as what the firm had initially pledged when it first revealed plans last year to manufacture cylindrical batteries for electric vehicles in Arizona, though the project had been up in the air until Friday\\'s announcement. LG Energy said in June 2022 that it was reassessing its investment options due to unprecedented economic conditions. Inflation has been driving up the costs of raw materials and other expenses for manufacturers worldwide. The complex announced Friday will consist of two battery plants and mark the largest investment ever for a stand-alone battery-manufacturing facility in North America, LG Energy said. LG Energy\\'s announcement comes as battery makers have been pushing to build up a bigger production base in the U.S., which is looking to strengthen its local supply chains and reduce reliance on China while speeding up shifts to green technologies. The Biden administration\\'s Inflation Reduction Act has offered billions of dollars in tax credits for EVs sold in the U.S., but applies only if they have a certain value of their battery components assembled in North America. LG Energy said the Arizona plant would meet the eligibility requirements of the EV tax-credits program. \"We believe it\\'s the right move at the right time in order to empower [the] clear energy transition in the U.S.,\" LG Energy Chief Executive Kwon Young-soo said. The EV tax-credits program has stoked complaints from foreign car makers, but has opened business opportunities for non-Chinese battery players including South Korea\\'s LG Energy, Samsung SDI Co. and SK On Co., as well as Japan\\'s Panasonic Holdings Corp., which have all announced plans for new manufacturing plants in the U.S., including many via joint partnership with auto makers.'],\n",
       " 'Mar 24, 2023': ['Vladimir Putin seeks to prevail in Ukraine through an exhausting war of attrition in which he outlasts his opponents, or so the expert consensus has it. The U.S. is supplying weapons to Ukraine at a remarkably slow pace, perhaps for fear of provoking a calamitous Russian escalation. It seems as if Washington is playing right into Mr. Putin\\'s hands. But maybe not everything is as it seems. If I learned anything from decades as a Russian-speaking Central Intelligence Agency operations officer working against the Kremlin\\'s intelligence services, it was to be wary of anything they show you. This looks to me too convenient a narrative for Moscow, and one that\\'s belied by the facts. WSJ Opinion Live Q&A: The New World Disorder The threats to global stability and the US homeland are growing. How will the war in Ukraine end? Can China and the US develop a less combative relationship? Join historian and Journal columnist Walter Russell Mead and editorial page editor Paul Gigot for an interactive conversation on the threats to US security. Mr. Putin acts as if he doesn\\'t believe he can survive if he quits this conflict. But in reality, the war is existential only for the Ukrainian side. Ukrainians would suffer cultural genocide and war crimes if they gave in. Russia can walk away without serious consequences beyond its borders, and Mr. Putin knows it. He can ill afford for the Russian people to realize that they could not only overcome defeat, but never had to fight in the first place. But it\\'s not clear that the solution the Kremlin really wants is a war of attrition. Can anyone, even Mr. Putin, imagine the Ukrainians quitting? If they lose external support, they still face an existential threat. It seems probable Ukraine would dig in and fight as long as it possibly could, even if the conflict devolved to guerrilla warfare in occupied streets. Mr. Putin has to be accounting for this. He gambled wrong a year ago when he expected Ukrainian resolve to collapse quickly as Russian forces rolled in. Though he projects an inflexible image, Mr. Putin seems to still think like an intelligence officer. They rarely make the same mistake twice, particularly when they\\'ve been embarrassed. Were he really as reckless and blind to reality as he\\'s sometimes depicted, Russian forces wouldn\\'t have withdrawn from Kyiv\\'s outskirts a year ago. Mr. Putin has shown that he will bend when faced with serious consequences. And that\\'s what a long war would entail. Mr. Putin might not grieve his heavy casualties, but they are embarrassing to the Kremlin and undermine his narrative of strength and military prowess. As Russian lines thin, he will feel increased pressure to expand mobilization beyond the rural and ethnic communities he has targeted to insulate his urban political base from the war\\'s consequences. While some scoff at the effectiveness of Western economic sanctions, Moscow is furiously working to strengthen the ruble and find alternative consumers for the energy exports most of Europe has forsaken. But this still means lower profit, as Russia lures clients with increasingly discounted oil and gas. As the war endures, Mr. Putin will meet increasingly difficult choices between funding the conflict and improving the economy. And whatever military supplies Russia seeks from China, Iran and North Korea are hardly charitable donations—there\\'s no dictator\\'s discount. Even ruble remittances from new trade partners won\\'t help Mr. Putin pay off foreign debt held in U.S. dollars. And less income leaves less resources to dispense to those domestic political allies Mr. Putin needs to maintain control. All this suggests that the longer the war endures, the worse things get for Moscow. Time allows Ukraine to deploy the sophisticated weapons now en route and the freshly trained Ukrainian operators returning from the West. More time will also enable the increased productivity of ammunition supply chains the U.S. is building. Add it all up, and Ukraine will likely have what\\'s needed for its much-anticipated counteroffensive. Mr. Putin may repulse those forces, but betting everything that he can is an immensely risky gamble. If Ukraine prevails, could he survive losing Crimea and having his forces violently pushed back across Russian borders? Mr. Putin likely doesn\\'t hope for a war of attrition but wants the world to think he does. His disinformation campaigns have been designed to depict himself, and Russia, as stronger than they are. If he faces an unwinnable war, the best outcome he can hope for is to mask that weakness and intimidate his foes into blinking first. Ukraine may not want to give up, but if an outside power can broker a peace deal, that is Mr. Putin\\'s best option by a long shot. His openness to China\\'s lopsided peace proposal suggests that he is eager to fold with gains still in hand. What he likely most fears is the U.S. and its allies slamming the accelerator. Pushing the Russian leader isn\\'t without risk, but validating his narrative is more likely to weaken Western resolve and escalate the conflict by inviting him to test its thresholds. It\\'s imperative that Washington instead work to make the war too costly to Mr. Putin to remove any doubt of Western resolve. Be wary of whatever cards he chooses to show.

       "  'CAIRO—After years of underinvestment in North Africa\\'s energy infrastructure, global oil-and-gas giants from Halliburton Co. and Chevron Corp. to Eni SpA are ramping up their presence in the region as demand from Europe grows . Executives in the industry are betting it is worth drilling again in some of the hardest places to do business in the world as Europe increasingly turns to other sources for its energy needs after shunning its main supplier, Russia, over the invasion of Ukraine . In recent months, a string of European officials have visited the region to help advance talks over potential supply deals. Halliburton and Honeywell International Inc. are hammering out $1.4 billion worth of deals to develop an oil field and refinery with National Oil Corporation in Libya, which has the largest known oil reserves in Africa, according to the chairman of state-owned firm, Farhat Bengdara. Italy\\'s Eni is planning investments aimed at replacing nearly half of the gas it was importing from Russia with gas from Algeria. Chevron is also looking to seal an energy exploration deal in Algeria, The Wall Street Journal reported last month . In January, the U.S. oil major announced a sizable natural-gas discovery in Egypt. \"North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,\" said Geoff Porter, president of U.S.-based North Africa Risk Consulting Inc. But with Europe needing to replace Russian energy , \"this is their moment,\" he said. Western oil executives say they see a more stable political climate in North Africa, especially in countries such as Libya where fighting between local militias has been subdued in the past two years following nearly a decade of civil war. Many American firms had pulled back from the region, viewing it as politically too risky, to focus on shale production at home. The region\\'s proximity to Europe and massive reserves, with Algeria holding the third-largest recoverable shale resources in the world, also make doing business there worth the risk, they say. At the same time, state-owned firms in the North African region have been eager to strike deals, as they see an opportunity to fill a gap left by Russia and take advantage of higher global commodity prices. Some countries, such as Egypt, are eager to bring in additional revenue from selling energy, as their economies struggle with higher import costs including for food . The Ukraine war has disrupted shipments and pushed up global commodity prices. \"I think we can be a good replacement for Russian gas to Europe,\" NOC\\'s Mr. Bengdara said. The Libyan state-owned company is expected to soon sign a $1 billion agreement with Halliburton that will allow the U.S. firm to rebuild the al-Dhara oil field, according to Mr. Bengdara. The oil field in central Libya was destroyed by Islamic State militants in 2015 and is now run by ConocoPhillips and TotalEnergies SE, Mr. Bengdara said. It would be one of the biggest deals for the U.S. oil-services giant clinched in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years. Halliburton and Total didn\\'t respond to requests for comment. ConocoPhillips declined to comment. Libya\\'s NOC and Honeywell are set to unveil a contract related to the construction of a refinery in southern Libya, Mr. Bengdara and a spokesman for the American firm said. The initial deal, expected to be announced this weekend, is for the design of the plant, the spokesman said, which would be followed by a $400 million pact to build the entire plant. Libya relies heavily on its oil resources for income, although it has struggled for years to turn its own crude into motor fuel, making it largely dependent on costly gasoline imports. As of last year, the North African nation was divided politically again, with a United Nations-appointed prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, remaining in control of the capital Tripoli and a rival prime minister taking charge of the country\\'s east. The country is again pushing to hold presidential and legislative elections this year, after plans fell through in 2021. Still, there have been no serious clashes since last summer and its eastern government in recent months has unlocked some of the budget needed by the state oil company to clinch deals with international companies. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a senate committee on Wednesday that the U.S. was actively working to reopen an embassy in Libya, in part so it could better support the prospect of Libyan elections. The U.S. shut its embassy in Tripoli in 2014 following violent clashes between militias. The U.S. also pressured a top Libyan commander in mid-January to expel Russia\\'s paramilitary Wagner Group , the Journal reported last month, amid fears the unit may tap into the country\\'s oil riches. Khalifa Haftar, commander of a faction that controls eastern Libya , is aligned with the government in Tripoli . \"There is recognition in the U.S. that Libya is a workable environment,\" said Mr. Porter, who advises U.S. oil companies in the region. He added that firms now see it as \"an environment in which you can operate reasonably safely, where you can more predictably invest in ways that you could not have a few years ago.\" NOC exports most of its gas to Europe through a pipeline from Libya to Italy. Over the next three to five years, it aims to increase oil production to 2 million barrels a day, from around 1.2 million currently, and to produce 4 billion standard cubic feet of gas a day, up from roughly 2.6 billion. In January, NOC and Eni, which produces the majority of the country\\'s gas, signed an $8 billion deal for the Italian energy giant to develop two gas fields to pump 850 million cubic feet a day for 25 years. Under the agreement, production of gas will start in 2025, ramping up to full capacity of 850 million cubic feet a day by 2026. In Algeria, Eni is aiming to export an additional 3 billion cubic meters of gas annually, starting this year, to help make up for gas that used to flow from Russia. Algeria will become the firm\\'s top region for investment in the next four years. \"Algeria is a reliable partner of absolute strategic importance,\" said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during a visit to Algiers in January. From Egypt, Eni aims to export three billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Italy starting this year, after regas capacity was built up on the receiving end. That compares with roughly 1 billion cubic meters being exported last year. Egypt\\'s ability to export gas is limited given the growing electricity demand of its more than 100 million population. It doesn\\'t have any pipelines to Europe. Still, the country has ambitions to become a hub for energy distribution in the Mediterranean, importing more gas from Israel and exporting liquefied gas on ships to Italy.

       "  'OTTAWA—President Biden, making his first trip as president to Canada , said a robust U.S. industrial policy based on producing clean technology, electric vehicles and semiconductors would benefit workers on both sides of the northern border as he joined with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Mr. Biden used an address to the Canadian Parliament to promote their commitment to defending Ukraine in its war against Russia , and future possibilities for workers through the new healthcare and climate change law called the Inflation Reduction Act, and another law to promote semiconductor manufacturing. \"We must never doubt our capacity for Canada and the United States to do big things, to stand together, do them together, rise together. We\\'re going to write the future together,\" Mr. Biden told members of Parliament, who frequently interrupted his address with applause. Canada is frequently among the first visits by a new U.S. president, but Mr. Biden\\'s trip was delayed in part due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The two leaders have maintained warm personal ties, going back to Mr. Biden\\'s time as vice president, and the two sides planned to confer on a range of defense, economic and migration issues. Mr. Trudeau, in an address to Parliament welcoming Mr. Biden, said the two nations were serving alongside each other during \"serious times,\" citing the \"consequences of a warming planet\" that are \"intersecting with the aftermath of a global pandemic.\" Mr. Trudeau said the passage of Mr. Biden\\'s legislation would mean \"clients for Canadian critical minerals processors, for our clean energy innovators, for our integrated auto workers, for our farmers, growers and producers and so many others.\" The Inflation Reduction Act offers extensive tax credits and other support for clean-energy projects, ranging from wind farms to factories that make solar-energy components or batteries. The incentives have sparked a flood of investments in the U.S., and to Canada as well. Canada is one of the few places in the Western Hemisphere with the raw materials required for the clean-energy transition, and the U.S. credits also cover products made in Canada. America\\'s clean-energy incentives have prompted governments in Europe and Asia to mull their own set of financial incentives to maintain or attract investments. The European Union plans to allow matching subsidies for specific European clean-tech sectors that officials believe are at risk from the IRA. As part of the meetings, the U.S. and Canada reached an agreement that would allow both countries to turn back asylum seekers who unlawfully cross the northern border, which has seen an influx in border crossings between New York and Quebec. Under the agreement, which begins Saturday, Canada would provide 15,000 slots for migrants to enter legally over the next year on a humanitarian basis from the Western Hemisphere. Mr. Biden later took questions from journalists during a joint news conference alongside Mr. Trudeau. The Canadian leader was capping the visit by holding a gala event honoring the president before Mr. Biden returned to his home in Wilmington, Del. The meetings in the Canadian capital followed Chinese President Xi Jinping\\'s talks this week in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Both Messrs. Biden and Trudeau have been staunch allies of Ukraine and the White House expressed skepticism about China\\'s interest in negotiating a cease-fire in Ukraine, saying it would provide Russian forces with an opportunity to regroup. \"We\\'ve stood together to defend sovereignty, to defend democracy,\" Mr. Biden said. Mr. Trudeau said both the U.S. and Canada \"must stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine with as much as it takes, for as long as it takes.\" On defense, Canada unveiled a timetable on spending plans to upgrade its defense capability in the Arctic, to track and detect threats from Russia and China, as part of the two countries\\' joint defense of continental aerospace through the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or Norad. U.S. officials pushed Canada to accelerate spending plans, and issue firm commitments on funding sources. Canada said some of the new detection systems could start operating in 2028. Defense of the Arctic has taken on greater emphasis after a U.S. military jet shot down an unidentified airborne object last month over Canada\\'s Yukon territory. Among NATO members, Canada has trailed in defense spending, at 1.27% of gross domestic product—well below the organization\\'s 2% guideline. The U.S. had pressed Mr. Trudeau to have Canada lead an international force in Haiti to deal with domestic unrest in the Caribbean country. Canada said Friday it would contribute about $70 million to help support Haitian police. Mr. Trudeau has said the country, which has a large Haitian Canadian community in Quebec, stands ready to help should the situation deteriorate, but has stopped short of committing to sending troops.',\n",
       "  'WASHINGTON—Momentum in Congress to crack down on TikTok is growing after the chief executive of the social-media company failed to win over lawmakers in a marathon hearing, though lawmakers are divided on what path to take . Republicans and Democrats pounced on TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, his company and its Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance Ltd., in the hearing Thursday. Over five hours, lawmakers seemed dissatisfied with Mr. Chew\\'s answers on Beijing\\'s potential influence over the video-sharing app, as well as concerns about the effect that the app\\'s algorithm has on teens and young adults. The TikTok hearing \"left more questions than answers,\" said Rep. John Curtis (R., Utah). \"I don\\'t think any of us walked away feeling that our data is safe or that there is any accountability for TikTok.\" Mr. Curtis hasn\\'t signed on to any bills yet, saying he wants to see details first. Several bills restricting TikTok use through privacy legislation or an outright ban on the app have been introduced in Congress or discussed, but no clear path has emerged. It remained unclear if lawmakers\\' denunciations of TikTok would result in passing legislation and sending it to President Biden\\'s desk. The idea of a ban started during the Trump administration and lawmakers from both parties have expressed concerns over the platform, which uses an algorithm to show users short-form videos. Last year, Congress passed legislation banning TikTok from federal government devices and some states have made similar moves. In a shift, Democrats who have seemed more resistant to banning the application or taking other actions also signaled they were more ready to join with Republicans on legislation to strengthen the government\\'s hand in fighting potential threats posed by foreign-controlled apps. \"There\\'s a groundswell of support for this, from Americans and elected officials on both sides of the aisle, as we see that this one app gives the [Chinese Communist Party] the ability to control what a generation of kids see and consume,\" said Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D., N.J.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, who has long advocated for a ban or sale of TikTok. \"There is bipartisan, growing consensus to get this app off of U.S. phones before further damage is done,\" said Rep. Ashley Hinson (R., Iowa). House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said he was engaged in talks about legislation with Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Mr. Warner is sponsoring legislation with Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) to give the government broad powers to restrict and even ban foreign-controlled apps that pose national-security risks. \"I think you could find a very bipartisan bill,\" Mr. McCarthy said Friday. \"I know the Senate is working on one but I believe the House will get one done and we\\'ll pass it through.\" The Warner-Thune bill, known as the Restrict Act, would grant the Commerce Department new authority to regulate foreign-owned apps. The White House reiterated Thursday that it backs the legislation. Any legislative steps on TikTok or big tech are tricky, both politically and practically. Adopting new laws restricting foreign apps has its own complexities, including potential First Amendment implications. The hearing also showed growing consensus to take action to amend Section 230, a provision in the 1996 Communications Decency Act that spells out who is legally responsible for content on the internet. It shields social-media companies from responsibility for what is posted on their sites. Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D., N.Y.) hosted a press conference on Thursday with about 20 TikTok influencers and suggested xenophobia against China was at play and Congress should focus instead on addressing broader concerns about social media. The Biden administration recently demanded that TikTok\\'s Chinese owners sell their stakes in the company or face a possible U.S. ban of the app. Mr. Chew told lawmakers he didn\\'t think a change in ownership would improve safety and security, pointing to the privacy problems of U.S. tech platforms. China issued a statement ahead of the hearing saying it would oppose any forced sale of TikTok , with its Commerce Ministry saying that any sale would involve the export of Chinese technology and must be approved by the Chinese government. TikTok executives have said that 60% of ByteDance shares are owned by global investors, 20% by employees and 20% by its founders, though the founders\\' shares carry outsize voting rights, as is common with tech companies. TikTok has pledged to spend $1.5 billion on a program to safeguard U.S. user data and content from Chinese government access or influence. Lawmakers who favor putting restrictions on the company have said that plan isn\\'t sufficient, saying any Chinese-owned company must comply with demands from Beijing if called upon. Many in Congress said they would back stricter controls on apps tied to hostile governments, but also wanted to enact comprehensive privacy legislation affecting all big tech platforms, not just foreign-controlled ones. \"We must prevent any app, website, and platform like TikTok from ever spying on Americans again and we must provide the strongest protections possible for our children,\" said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.), who chairs the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. Some lawmakers urged caution. \"Taking a step to ban access to a media platform is a very big step,\" said Rep. Jim Himes (D., Conn.), a member of the intelligence panel. \"Are we going to ban access to Belarusian newspapers, you know? I\\'m not saying it\\'s wrong. I\\'m just saying let\\'s slow the feeding frenzy down now and take a deep breath,\" he said.',\n",
       "  'BROWNSVILLE, Texas—Some 1,000 trucks a day arrive from Mexico at a border checkpoint here near the southern tip of Texas. Their first stop is a white-and-yellow painted metal portal where energy beamed at the trucks produces X-ray images to try to spot fentanyl and other contraband. Such scrutiny is rare. Across the southern border, most U.S.-bound trucks and nearly all passenger vehicles are generally scanned selectively if they are pulled aside. Mexican cartels have long profited from these odds while smuggling fentanyl and other narcotics . Their illicit trade propelled the U.S. to a record of nearly 107,000 fatal overdoses in 2021, the most recent year of full data. The U.S. wants to increase routine scanning of vehicles arriving from Mexico. President Biden called for more drug-detection technology in last month\\'s State of the Union speech and this month\\'s budget proposal, which included $305 million for new inspection systems, including the technology used in Brownsville. Mexican cartels are the main source of illicit fentanyl , producing it in makeshift labs with Chinese chemicals , according to U.S. law-enforcement authorities. Though cartels have many ways to smuggle in drugs—from mailed packages to secret tunnels and pedestrian couriers—authorities said fentanyl is most often hidden in cars and trucks and driven through border checkpoints. \"They\\'re just blitzing the country through the ports of entry,\" said Derek Maltz, a retired Drug Enforcement Administration official who spent 28 years in the agency. The scanners in Brownsville beam energy at a truck in varying levels of intensity. Beaming less energy at the cab allows drivers to stay inside, speeding the process. Directing more energy at the trailer produces an image of the truck that officials can use to spot suspect material within. Sometimes the payload is illicit drugs including fentanyl. Fentanyl\\'s properties—it is cheap and extremely potent in small amounts —make it ideal for smuggling, drug-enforcement experts said. And the busy southern border, a vital link between major trading partners, sees a flood of cars and trucks crossing each day. \"The sheer volume is one of the biggest challenges that we have,\" said Jody Hardin, executive director for planning program analysis and evaluation at U.S. Customs and Border Protection\\'s Office of Field Operations. The explosive opioid problem and violent cartel crime have heightened tensions between the U.S. and Mexico. Just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, in the city of Matamoros, gunmen from a local cartel in March kidnapped four Americans, killing two . Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has denied that fentanyl is produced in Mexico while touting renewed cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico in attempts to stop the synthetic opioid from flowing north. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas visited Nogales, Ariz., on March 21 to announce busts following a law-enforcement operation aimed at fentanyl trafficking. Mr. Mayorkas said the new law-enforcement operation netted some 1,700 pounds of drugs identified as fentanyl, methamphetamine and cocaine. More broadly, U.S. authorities say they have seen a significant increase in fentanyl seizures in the current fiscal year. Customs officials want to perform more of what they call nonintrusive inspections, which include the multi-energy portals on display in Brownsville, to increase the efficiency of processing the huge volume of vehicles arriving daily. \"At the onset, we saw a drastic increase in narcotics seizures,\" said Tater Ortiz, who directs the Brownsville port of entry. But a string of busts was followed by a plunge in confiscations as smugglers went elsewhere, he said. The scans flag vehicles that need to be more thoroughly checked, Ms. Hardin said. Two other Texas border sites are using low-energy scanning equipment that can peer into cars, she said. The U.S. aims to deploy 123 large-scale scanners along the border by fiscal 2026, growing its ability to perform nonintrusive scans to 70% of cargo vehicles and 40% of passenger vehicles, according to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Historically, the U.S. has only performed such scans on 17% of cargo vehicles and 2% of passenger vehicles, the office said. Adding more scanning technology has to be part of an effort that includes trying to reduce drug demand and the odds overdoses will prove fatal, said David Luckey, a senior Rand Corp. researcher. He co-led a team that produced a report last year for a commission on synthetic opioids that includes members of Congress and law-enforcement agencies. \"There\\'s no silver bullet,\" he said. Outside Culiacán, home to the Sinaloa Cartel, the operator of a fentanyl lab and counterfeit pill factory said he isn\\'t bothered by the prospect of new technology. \"They don\\'t stop all the cars,\" he said. \"There are lots of ways.\" He said the price of fentanyl has fallen in recent months from about $5,000 per kilogram to $3,500 per kilogram as more people get into the business. Dr. Rahul Gupta, Mr. Biden\\'s drug czar, said the administration is disrupting the flow of drugs. He cited preliminary federal overdose reports tracking 12-month death totals, month by month, which have recently edged lower. Preliminary numbers through October indicate the U.S. might still record more than 100,000 fatalities for the second year in a row . At the Brownsville bridge, tractor-trailer trucks, many full of auto parts, line up each day in lanes for their scans. Mr. Ortiz, who has served on the border for 32 years, said he doesn\\'t expect a panacea against drug smugglers. \"They always try something new,\" he said. \"So I\\'m sure we will have troubles in the future.\"',\n",
       "  'America\\'s biggest cigarette company has a new plan to shift its business toward less-harmful products, after a string of failures. This time, the Marlboro maker says, its plan will work. Altria Group Inc. earlier this month divested itself of e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc., recording a loss of at least $12.5 billion. Altria now has a new lineup of e-cigarettes, heated-tobacco devices and oral nicotine pouches in the works, including the planned acquisition of vaping pioneer NJOY Holdings Inc. Altria said it hopes to take its reduced-risk products overseas and is considering expanding into non-nicotine offerings such as cannabis products or caffeine pouches. \"Previously, we were chasing the market,\" Chief Executive Billy Gifford said in an interview, referring to Altria\\'s past attempts to develop or acquire vaping products. \"You\\'re constantly watching what the consumer is telling you in the marketplace, but none of them were satisfying the consumer enough to ultimately meet all of their needs and desires.\" Now Altria is soliciting smokers\\' feedback during the development process, and making tweaks based on that feedback, Mr. Gifford said. Altria this week for the first time set volume and revenue goals for its transition to smoke-free products: It aims to increase its smoke-free sales volume by at least 35% over the next five years. Altria agreed to buy vaping pioneer NJOY Holdings earlier this month. PHOTO: Angela Owens/The Wall Street Journal It also wants to roughly double its net revenue from smoke-free products to $5 billion by 2028, including $2 billion from new reduced-risk products. Last year, Altria reported $2.6 billion in net revenue from smoke-free products, nearly all from moist smokeless-tobacco brands such as Copenhagen. Many of the new products in Altria\\'s plan haven\\'t yet been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration and can\\'t go on the market until they are. That process could take years. NJOY is one of the few e-cigarette makers whose products have clearance from federal regulators. But Altria\\'s acquisition must first pass a federal antitrust review. Mr. Gifford said he is optimistic but can\\'t project when the deal would close. Altria\\'s lineup includes two prototypes unveiled this week: a higher-nicotine version of its On! pouch and a device called Swic that heats a single-use metal capsule containing tobacco. The FDA so far has authorized only tobacco-flavored vaping products . NJOY plans to seek authorization for watermelon and blueberry flavors in a new version of its device that uses a Bluetooth connection to authenticate the user before unlocking, according to people familiar with the matter. Altria in 2018 voluntarily pulled its own fruit-flavored e-cigarettes off the market, saying that those flavors were contributing to a rise in underage use. In the interview Thursday, Mr. Gifford said that flavored e-cigarettes help adult smokers switch from cigarettes and that NJOY\\'s locked version would mitigate the risk to young people. Speaking about the company\\'s plans to explore non-nicotine products, Mr. Gifford pointed to people who used to use cigarettes to take a break, reward themselves, multitask or socialize. \"Those consumers didn\\'t stop enjoying those moments,\" he said. \"They replaced it with other stuff. It could be caffeine—anything in that energy space. Some are now using their phone.\" Altria executives said they hope to use non-nicotine products to reach a broader consumer base in similar everyday moments. \"How do you meet them in that moment and fix their unmet needs and desires?\" Mr. Gifford said. Altria struggled for years to develop e-cigarettes that appealed to smokers as U.S. cigarette sales declined. Among the stumbling blocks was trouble recruiting product developers. The company\\'s e-cigarettes leaked. And they lacked the nicotine kick smokers were looking for. Altria closed its e-cigarette business in 2018, shortly before it paid nearly $13 billion for a 35% stake in Juul . The vaping market leader\\'s valuation quickly evaporated . Altria last year recruited Olivier Houpert, an alumnus of Procter & Gamble Co., to be its chief innovation and product officer. Mr. Gifford said he hopes to bring talent from NJOY. And he said Altria is better able to recruit now because of its remote-work policy. He and Mr. Houpert said the company plans to invest in early-stage startups with promising technology and to work with external partners on technical aspects such as electronics. Mr. Gifford served as Altria\\'s finance chief before he was tapped in 2020 to succeed Howard Willard , the CEO who forged the company\\'s ill-fated Juul deal. Mr. Gifford, who grew up outside Richmond, Va., said he began dipping Copenhagen smokeless tobacco on hunting trips with his father. Now 52, he said he exclusively uses On!, Altria\\'s oral nicotine-pouch brand. At an investor presentation Thursday, he had a cinnamon-flavored pouch tucked in his cheek as he fielded questions from analysts. States including California are enforcing bans on menthol cigarettes, and the Biden Administration is moving forward with plans to ban them nationwide . The administration also has said it intends to mandate the near-elimination of nicotine in all cigarettes sold in the U.S. The menthol and nicotine rules would take years to implement. Altria opposes both and has been lobbying for policies that \"support harm reduction and avoid prohibition,\" executives said. Cigarette smoking is linked to 480,000 deaths in the U.S. each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. U.S. health officials have said they want to encourage cigarette smokers who can\\'t quit to switch to less-harmful products such as e-cigarettes.',\n",
       "  'Global economic growth rebounded modestly this month, although stubbornly high inflation and banking stresses weigh on the outlook. Business surveys published Friday recorded pickups in activity across the U.S. and Europe driven by services providers. Japan saw a similar acceleration aided by the arrival of tourists from China after the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. Policy makers in the U.S. and Europe in particular are navigating treacherous currents this year. Central banks have kept raising interest rates to cool economic activity and bring down persistently high inflation. But those higher rates are causing pain in the financial sector, including recent failures of U.S. banks including Silicon Valley Bank and troubles for European banks such as Deutsche Bank AG. The U.S. economy showed signs of strength early this year, with a solid job market and increased consumer spending. If banks tighten credit in response to industry stress, though, that could in turn cool the economy and raise the risk of a recession. Confidence slipped at U.S. businesses to a three-month low in March, according to a Friday survey by data firm S&P Global, amid worries about inflation, financial-market uncertainty and higher borrowing costs. But the survey, conducted March 10 to 23, also reported the fastest uptick in business activity in almost a year, suggesting U.S. businesses have so far seen a limited impact from banking-sector stresses. Surveys of European businesses conducted by S&P Global also pointed to a pickup in growth, and the avoidance of a recession that many had predicted when energy prices surged in the wake of Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago. Rapid rate rises in the U.S. and Europe this past year have jolted the regions\\' economies, with some banks becoming casualties. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank roiled markets and sent depositors fleeing, stoking fears of contagion. Regulators bailed out uninsured depositors to stave off a panic. In Europe, regulators shepherded UBS Group AG\\'s takeover of longtime rival Credit Suisse Group AG, which had been weakened by years of self-inflicted scandals and trading losses. Central bankers and regulators have said those strains have been contained, but it may take months before confidence in the banking system is fully restored. \"There are good chances to contain this,\" said Jens Magnusson, chief economist at Sweden\\'s SEB. \"We will have weeks and probably months when we will have to be very attentive to any signs of stress.\" In addition to U.S. and European economic resilience, China\\'s abandonment of its zero-Covid policy has pointed to a better-than-expected outlook for the global economy this year. And while recent data points to a pickup in activity within China itself, business surveys also point to positive impacts elsewhere. Japan\\'s services sector grew at the fastest pace since October 2013 as Chinese tourists rushed to take advantage of their new freedom to travel overseas. Stronger growth comes with its own downsides for central bankers who have been busy pouring cold water on the global economy. While the business surveys also pointed to a slowdown in the pace at which businesses are raising their prices, that pace remains very high by historical standards. \"Such stubborn inflationary pressures, fueled primarily by the service sector and rising wage costs, will be a concern to policy makers and suggest that more work may be needed in terms of bringing inflation down to target,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. When strains in the banking system first became apparent, investors trimmed expectations of future rate rises by the world\\'s leading central banks. But those central banks have recently announced a series of rate increases, with some signaling that there are likely to be more to come given the persistence of high inflation. The Federal Reserve approved another quarter-percentage-point interest-rate increase on Wednesday, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaling that banking-industry problems might end U.S. rate increases sooner than previously thought. The depth of the banking crisis will determine the path of the global economy, economists say. \"If there are no further problems, it\\'s a has-been and the global economy will keep on chugging,\" said Jesse Rogers, an economist at Moody\\'s Analytics. \"If there\\'s broader rot that we\\'re yet to find out about, we\\'re in a recession in the U.S., with most areas of the global economy in recession,\" he added.',\n",
       "  'SINGAPORE—China\\'s Foreign Ministry criticized the U.S. for targeting TikTok and said Beijing would never require companies to illegally gather data and intelligence from overseas, escalating the debate over the popular app a day after its chief executive was pummeled in Congress . The U.S. has presumed TikTok\\'s guilt and unreasonably suppressed the app, even though the government has provided no evidence that TikTok threatens its national security , Mao Ning, a ministry spokeswoman, said Friday. \"The Chinese government has never asked and will never ask any company or individual to collect or provide data, information or intelligence located in other countries through means that are in violation of local laws,\" she said. The remarks came a day after lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee hammered TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew in a five-hour hearing Thursday. Mr. Chew had sought to allay lawmakers\\' concerns about the security of TikTok users\\' data, as well as about whether China influences content that 150 million American users consume , but appeared to change few minds. His job was made harder when China\\'s Commerce Ministry weighed in ahead of the hearing, saying it would strongly oppose any demand that TikTok\\'s Chinese owners sell their stakes, adding that a sale or divestiture of TikTok would require government approval. The travails of TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., have put it at the center of strained ties between the world\\'s two great economic powers. Swelling bipartisan skepticism after the hearing could cloud the app\\'s future in its most lucrative market. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.) opened the hearing by asking Mr. Chew to state \"with 100% certainty\" that Beijing couldn\\'t use TikTok to surveil Americans or manipulate the content Americans see. Mr. Chew said the company is committed to firewalling U.S. user data from \"all unwanted foreign access\" and would keep content \"free from any manipulation from any government.\" \"If you can\\'t say it 100% certain, I take that as a \\'no,\\'\" Mrs. Rodgers shot back. Mr. Chew said Project Texas—a TikTok proposal to store U.S. user data in the country with oversight by American personnel—addresses the concern that TikTok user data could be accessed by Beijing. He also acknowledged that currently engineers globally could access such data as required for business purposes. His responses did little to damp the fury on Capitol Hill. Rep. Frank Pallone (D., N.J.), the panel\\'s top Democrat, said he wasn\\'t convinced that TikTok\\'s security plans would work. \"I still believe that the Beijing communist government will still control and have the ability to influence what you do,\" he said. After the hearing ended, TikTok spokeswoman Brooke Oberwetter said political grandstanding had dominated, ignoring solutions that TikTok was working on to protect user data and keep content harmful to young people off the site.',\n",
       "  'TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has kept out of the limelight until recently. PHOTO: Alyssa Schukar for The Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON—TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Zi Chew has navigated both Western and Chinese business over the course of his fast rise to the corner office. That cultural straddle has helped land him the top job at one of the world\\'s biggest tech companies. His background also provided a potential connection with a skeptical American Congress . Many members have threatened to ban TikTok , saying its Chinese ownership poses a national-security threat . But on Thursday, the 40-year-old Singaporean army reservist and former Goldman Sachs banker faced a hostile House panel as he tried to reassure Americans their data is safe and Beijing won\\'t be able to influence what viewers see on TikTok. Hours before the testimony, Beijing said it would oppose a forced sale of the app from its Chinese owners, something the Biden administration has demanded . That amped up the hearing\\'s geopolitical dimensions, thrusting Mr. Chew into the middle of souring U.S.-China relations. House lawmakers then pummeled TikTok\\'s chief executive over the popular app\\'s ties to China. The congressional hearing was peppered with withering attacks on TikTok from both Democrats and Republicans, running more than five hours and underscoring growing concern about Beijing\\'s potential influence over the app. Born and raised in Singapore, then educated in London and at Harvard Business School, Mr. Chew spent some of his early career cutting deals for a venture-capital firm in Asia. He then quickly moved to the C-suite as the chief financial officer of a Chinese smartphone giant at age 32. He runs TikTok from offices in Singapore, but travels often, including frequently to the U.S. He met his wife, a Taiwanese-American who grew up in Bethesda, Md., at Harvard. Relatively unknown for the boss of one of the world\\'s most popular apps, Mr. Chew was sharply questioned by some of the company\\'s more skeptical critics on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Aides to the Republicans who control the committee say there is essentially nothing Mr. Chew can say that would change their minds as they threaten a nationwide ban. In an interview from the company\\'s WeWork offices in Washington, he said he views Thursday\\'s hearing as a chance to explain what TikTok is trying to do, and to get feedback from Congress members—not a last-gasp effort to save TikTok\\'s American business. \"I look at it as an opportunity to do that, not a do-or-die\" moment, he said. The corporate stakes for Mr. Chew are as high as they get for a CEO facing such an appearance in Washington. Some Congress members from both major parties are pushing for a nationwide ban of the video app, citing national-security threats. The Biden administration is demanding TikTok divest itself from its Chinese parent ByteDance Ltd. or face such a ban. Critics say China could force TikTok to hand over American user data or influence what American viewers see on the app. TikTok has said it has never received such a request and would refuse to comply with one. Mr. Chew took over the top job after Kevin Mayer, a high-profile Walt Disney Co. alum, left his post after three months, while the Trump administration pursued an earlier effort to force a sale of TikTok to U.S. investors. He is a native English speaker who, like most Singaporeans, is of Chinese ancestry. His father worked in construction and his mother in bookkeeping. He said he was uprooted from a modest upbringing at age 12, when high marks on a national exam sent him to an elite high school. Mr. Chew was put on an officer track during his mandatory 2½ years of military service. That added 10 years to his eligibility for reserve duty, which ends when he is 50. The hardest physical experience of his life, he said, was the military\\'s five-day survival course in Brunei\\'s jungles. He built a hut, cooked wild yams and trekked 55 miles. At one point during such courses, trainees are given a live quail that they can kill with their hands before skinning and cooking it. In the interview, Mr. Chew didn\\'t want to discuss what he did with his bird. After the military, Mr. Chew attended University College London and remained in the British capital to work as a banker for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Following an internship at Meta Platforms Inc.\\'s Facebook and business school, Mr. Chew worked for venture-capital firm DST Global. His high-school-level Mandarin qualified him to be its China-focused partner. In 2012, he visited the Chinese equivalent of a Silicon Valley garage: an apartment in Beijing\\'s university district. Thirty people, including a chef, crammed in to develop an app that suggested news articles to people based on factors such as how much time they spent on previous stories. The company was ByteDance Ltd ., which would later go on to create TikTok. Its founder, a young Zhang Yiming, won over Mr. Chew. He and his partners invested in the company. \"The idea is so simple but so powerful: that you should be looking at content not based on who you know, but really based on your own behavior,\" Mr. Chew said. Another investment Mr. Chew led was in Xiaomi Corp., a Chinese smartphone giant with global ambitions. Xiaomi brought him over first as chief financial officer, and then had him run its business outside China. One thing that stood out among colleagues was his grasp of both Chinese and Western business cultures. \"He\\'s perfectly bicultural,\" said Hugo Barra, a former Xiaomi executive who worked with Mr. Chew. \"That\\'s a critical asset for an executive of a Chinese company trying to become a global company.\" Mr. Chew led Xiaomi to an initial public offering in 2018, but its shares struggled immediately afterward, during a difficult financial period for Chinese tech companies. In 2021, Mr. Zhang, who had kept in touch with Mr. Chew, asked the Singaporean to become the finance chief of ByteDance, which in addition to TikTok operates other popular Chinese apps. Mr. Chew did that for two months until he and the founder decided he would be better off running TikTok. TikTok has rolled out billions of dollars of spending aimed at siloing off the app from its Chinese owners, and it said it would hire Oracle Corp. to independently monitor against any interference by Beijing. The measures amount to what the company says is an unprecedented effort to assure Americans their data is safe—one that keeps TikTok unprofitable for now. TikTok faces the ban from Washington while it continues to be hugely popular across the country. Mr. Chew, in his own TikTok video on Tuesday, appealed directly to American users, calling attention to the possible ban. In the video he said the app had 150 million users in the U.S., almost half the country\\'s population. Mr. Chew said he accepted the commerce committee\\'s invitation because he wanted to address misconceptions about TikTok, both to Congress and the American public. \"There are some things [being said] that are outright just wrong about our company, and we do need to clarify it,\" he said in the interview. In his testimony Thursday, he said TikTok acknowledged the security concerns that Congress members raised. \"Our approach has never been to dismiss or trivialize any of these concerns,\" he said. \"We have addressed them with real action.\" Rep. Frank Pallone (D., N.J.), the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, issued a blunt response to Mr. Chew\\'s claims. \"I don\\'t buy it,\" Mr. Pallone said.',\n",
       "  \"Ford Motor Co. plans to build 500,000 electric trucks a year at its forthcoming manufacturing complex in Tennessee, one of the auto maker's largest commitments yet to expanding battery-powered options in the highly competitive pickup-truck market . The Dearborn, Mich., car company said Friday it plans to start production of its next-generation electric truck in 2025 at a new factory campus, called Blue Oval City, located about 50 miles from Memphis. This truck will follow the rollout last year of the Ford F-150 Lightning, an all-electric version of its bestselling full-size pickup. The 500,000-truck production target for Tennessee represents a significant step up in manufacturing capacity for the company's line of pickup trucks, historically among its biggest moneymakers. Last year, Ford built about one million trucks overall at several plants in North America. It also comes as other car companies, including crosstown rival General Motors Co. and electric-vehicle leader Tesla Inc., are rushing to put out their own battery-powered trucks, filling a market niche that has seen a surge in consumer demand in recent years. Chief Executive Jim Farley said the new factory would add to Ford's existing truck-building capacity and is needed because the company expects to win over new buyers with the next-generation EV pickup. With the Lightning, 70% to 80% of customers are new to Ford, he added. Ford has twice increased production of the Lightning truck as it has worked to fill a backlog of orders. The auto maker is investing heavily to build new factories, including those that make batteries, and expand its lineup of electric offerings, pledging to produce two million EVs annually by 2026. Right now, the expenditures are becoming a drag on the company's bottom line. On Thursday, Ford said its ambitions to scale EV sales and production led to a $2.1 billion pretax loss in 2022 for its electric-vehicle unit. It projects to post a $3 billion operating loss on its EV business this year. The 3,600-acre Blue Oval City campus, which includes a battery plant and an auto assembly factory , is core to Ford's efforts to become the top seller in the electric-vehicle space, a crown long held by Tesla. Together with South Korean battery maker SK On, the two companies are spending $5.6 billion on the complex. When fully operational, it will employ about 6,000 people, the company said Friday. Mr. Farley declined to say whether workers at the Tennessee complex would be unionized, only that the decision would be up to the employees. Hourly workers at Ford's other U.S. factories are represented by the United Auto Workers union. Ford sells two other EVs now: a plug-in commercial van and the Mustang Mach-E SUV. Last year, it sold about 61,000 EVs in the U.S. The company has joined with SK to produce batteries for the Lightning truck, as well as the next-generation pickup. While sales of the F-150 Lightning have been brisk, the car company recently ran into challenges at its factory in Dearborn, Mich., where it makes the truck. Ford had to suspend production there for five weeks in February and March as it investigated an electric truck that caught fire in a holding lot. The auto maker said the root cause was an internal battery short circuit that occurred when the vehicle was at a high state of charge. It recalled 18 Lightning trucks with the defective batteries in early March and said the problem was limited to batteries built within a certain time frame. Ford is among a number of auto makers shelling out billions of dollars to build EV plants and battery factories in the U.S., a trend that has been accelerated by new incentives offered under the Inflation Reduction Act. Much of that investment is flowing to Southern states such as Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina, which have lower energy costs and more turnkey construction sites. In addition to the complex in Tennessee, Ford is building two battery factories in Kentucky with SK.\",\n",
       "  'SEOUL—South Korea\\'s LG Energy Solution Ltd. said it would invest about $5.6 billion in a battery-manufacturing complex in Arizona, the latest in a string of new plants by foreign companies as the U.S. transitions toward cleaner fuels. LG Energy said Friday that the new battery complex in Queen Creek, Ariz., will mainly serve electric-vehicle makers in North America. The amount is about four times larger than what the firm had initially pledged when it first revealed plans last year to manufacture cylindrical batteries for electric vehicles in Arizona, though the project had been up in the air until Friday\\'s announcement. LG Energy said in June 2022 that it was reassessing its investment options due to unprecedented economic conditions. Inflation has been driving up the costs of raw materials and other expenses for manufacturers worldwide. The complex announced Friday will consist of two battery plants and mark the largest investment ever for a stand-alone battery-manufacturing facility in North America, LG Energy said. LG Energy\\'s announcement comes as battery makers have been pushing to build up a bigger production base in the U.S., which is looking to strengthen its local supply chains and reduce reliance on China while speeding up shifts to green technologies. The Biden administration\\'s Inflation Reduction Act has offered billions of dollars in tax credits for EVs sold in the U.S., but only applies if they have a certain value of their battery components assembled in North America. LG Energy said the Arizona plant will meet the eligibility requirements of the EV tax-credits program under the IRA. \"We believe it\\'s the right move at the right time in order to empower [the] clear energy transition in the U.S.,\" LG Energy Chief Executive Kwon Young-soo said. The EV tax-credits program has stoked complaints from foreign car makers, but has opened business opportunities for non-Chinese battery players including South Korea\\'s LG Energy, Samsung SDI Co. and SK On Co. as well as Japan\\'s Panasonic Holdings Corp., which have all announced plans for new manufacturing plants in the U.S., including many via joint partnership with auto makers. LG Energy is the world\\'s second-largest producer of EV batteries after China\\'s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., and has been seeking growth in the U.S. , where it has seen a boost from Washington\\'s legislation intended to subsidize clean-energy industries and to reduce economic dependence on China. When excluding China\\'s CATL, LG Energy is the top battery maker globally, accounting for 21% of the combined EV and energy-storage-system battery market by units sold last year, according to Seoul-based market-research firm SNE Research. In addition to the Arizona complex, LG Energy is working to expand its battery-manufacturing base across North America. It has three plants it has built or is building across the U.S. with General Motors Co. as well as one planned plant with Honda Motor Co. in Ohio and one with Stellantis NV in Canada. For the coming Arizona complex, the South Korean battery maker plans to spend roughly $3.2 billion on one plant for building cylindrical batteries serving electric vehicles with a production capacity of 27 gigawatt-hours. It is expected to start mass production in 2025. The remaining amount will be spent on another plant for producing lithium-iron-phosphate pouch-type batteries used for energy storage systems, with a capacity of 16 gigawatt-hours. It is expected to start mass production in 2026, according to LG Energy.',\n",
       "  'Manipulation of earnings from Corporate America is on the rise, an ominous omen for the U.S. economy. That is the conclusion of new research on accounting fraud, using a technique that flagged Enron as an earnings manipulator several years before the energy company\\'s spectacular 2001 implosion. Unless you study accounting, you have likely never come across the M-Score, which is the number underlying both the Enron episode and the economywide concern now. The \"M\" is for manipulation, and uses a company\\'s financial statements to determine whether it is engaging in manipulation. Since the 1990s, the metric has been used to identify red flags at individual companies. Now Messod D. Beneish, a professor of accounting at Indiana University who developed the M-Score in the 1990s, and several co-authors have calculated an aggregate score for nearly 2,000 companies. It shows a disturbing pattern in the historical data: The probability of manipulation usually rises rapidly in the quarters before the economy tips into recession. \"We think this is a measure of misinformation in the economy,\" said Dr. Beneish. The new aggregate measure was published in a December paper, and the latest data—compiled in March and shared with The Wall Street Journal—shows that the collective probability of fraud across major companies is the highest in over 40 years. The M-Score is calculated from eight ratios on a company\\'s balance sheet, all numbers that public companies report quarterly, and comparing the ratios to earnings statements from a year earlier. For example, one of the eight metrics raises a flag if a company abruptly starts reporting more \"receivables,\" that is, more money owed to the firm but not yet paid. Another flag goes up if a company reports higher values of assets that cannot be sold, and that aren\\'t clearly identified as plants, property or equipment. A third metric looks at changes in accruals, which is when an expense has been incurred, but not yet paid. Another identifies whether companies change how much depreciation they take. There are ways for companies to manipulate all these metrics to appear profitable even when actual sales aren\\'t improving. Of course, there could be legitimate reasons for any of these. A customer might have placed a large order toward the end of the quarter, yet won\\'t pay until early in the next quarter. A drug company might have purchased a major patent, which isn\\'t easily sold. It isn\\'t a factory, but it is genuinely very valuable. But collectively, if these metrics are moving in the wrong direction, it suggests funny business. The M-Score\\'s most famous moment came when it was revealed that three years before Enron\\'s collapse , a group of students at Cornell University\\'s business school, under accounting professor Charles Lee, used Dr. Beneish\\'s model to flag that Enron \"may be a company manipulating its earnings.\" Though their report was posted online, it received little attention until after Enron\\'s collapse. The model also flagged the German payment-processor Wirecard AG . Its spectacular collapse after accounting fraud was exposed in 2020 drew comparisons with Enron. On June 17 that year, the firm was valued at $14 billion, and eight days later it filed for the equivalent of bankruptcy. Dr. Lee noted that the M-Score also flagged strange accounting at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. before an accounting scandal at the chain in 2004 . Dr. Lee, now a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, says that any of the eight metrics wouldn\\'t necessarily mean trouble. But when the score of the combined metrics is rising, it shows \"a growth company, with core businesses that are eroding, that is running out of economic steam and using aggressive accounting,\" he said. Even if the accounting is legitimate, he added, \"you may want to avoid that company.\" Similar scores have been popular in accounting since the late 1960s. There is the Altman Z-score , created in 1968 by Edward Altman, for predicting whether companies are at risk of bankruptcy, and the Dechow F-Score, from the University of Southern California\\'s Patricia Dechow, designed to predict accounting misstatements . Models such as the M-Score aren\\'t necessarily smoking guns. They will sometimes flag legitimate businesses, especially with mergers and acquisitions. Strange shifts occur when companies absorb each other. They are, though, a reason to look more closely. \"You cannot take it to court and say, \\'Look, this company has a big M-Score and must be a fraud,\\' \" said Dr. Lee. \"But statistically, this fits the profile of a manipulator.\" In aggregate, when more firms are reporting sales that haven\\'t actually been completed, declining asset quality or any of the other indicators, it likely indicates that something in the economy is beginning to go wrong. And there is no shortage of signs of strain in the economy right now. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, several high-profile banks have collapsed, manufacturing activity has slowed and home prices are declining. Still, there is reason to think that the M-Score has something to add to the traditional numbers used to take stock of economic activity. False information on balance sheets has \"real economic effects because it represents misinformation on which firms base their investment, hiring, and production decisions,\" Dr. Beneish and his co-authors—David Farber of Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis and Matthew Glendening and Kenneth Shaw, both of the University of Missouri—wrote in December. The theory is that their index might be catching distress in the stages when some companies are taking steps to try to cover it up. That is when conditions on the ground are beginning to deteriorate, but firms are continuing to report strong earnings. The stock market might behave like the corporate sector is still humming along when in reality, its earnings are increasingly buoyed by tricks. The scholars\\' aggregate index is too new to have much of a record. Financial history is littered with recession predictors that worked great using historical data that promptly failed when used to predict the future. It didn\\'t work \"out of sample,\" as statisticians would say. So, it remains to be seen how useful the aggregate M-Score will be. But if there are a lot of things on balance sheets right now that look like fraud, that is probably not a great thing.',\n",
       "  'Hedge funds that bet on big-picture market moves have been hit with steep losses as recent bank failures upend bets that interest rates would remain elevated. The souring of the wager led some, including Maniyar Capital Advisors and Haidar Capital Management, to lose more than 20% this month. Many of the funds, which had notched big gains as rates marched steadily upward in 2022, are now flat to down for the year following a steep recent drop in Treasury yields. Trend followers, which try to take advantage of momentum in markets, also were hurt. Some macro funds sustained lesser losses. Bridgewater Associates\\'s flagship Pure Alpha fund had lost a little more than 3% in March through Friday in its higher-volatility share class, while Switzerland-based ED Capital, started by former Moore Capital Management money manager Edouard de Langlade, lost 5%, said people familiar with the firms. Overall, macro hedge funds lost an average 3.5% in the period, according to data from research firm HFR. Macro investors since late 2021 had widely been betting that stubbornly high inflation and a tight job market would cause the Federal Reserve to raise rates faster and for longer than previously expected. Instead, recent banking turmoil put a dent in rate expectations, with the yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note notching its largest weekly decline since 1987 last week. Yields fall as bond prices rise. Bonds also surged overseas. Traders say losses funds were taking on their bets against Treasurys spread to Japanese government bonds as managers unwound similar bets in efforts to curb losses. Many of the funds use leverage, or borrowed money, to amplify their bets, which can boost gains if the wagers pay off but prove costly if they sour. \"The magnitude of the losses really boils down to the fact that this was a levered trade that abruptly unwound,\" said Greg Dowling, chief investment officer of investment-consulting firm Fund Evaluation Group. In the span of some 48 hours in early March, Silicon Valley Bank\\'s collapse changed investors\\' expectations about the path of interest rates in the U.S., Mr. Dowling said. Where investors previously expected that the Federal Reserve would continue to raise rates, they suddenly were confronted with the possibility that the central bank would ease up, fearing a banking crisis could tip the U.S. economy into recession. Such regime shifts are usually accompanied by months of changing data and messaging from the Fed. The Fed on Wednesday approved a quarter-percentage-point rate increase but signaled it might be done tightening sooner than previously expected, causing Treasury yields to slip further. London-based Maniyar, a macro hedge fund partly owned by Paul Tudor Jones, lost 22% for the month through Friday, according to people familiar with the firm. Haidar\\'s Jupiter fund, which gained 193% in 2022, lost 32% for the period, said a person familiar with the firm. Bloomberg News earlier reported Haidar\\'s loss. Among trend followers, which also profited by betting on higher rates last year, the Tactical Trend fund of the $18 billion Graham Capital Management lost about 10% for the month through Friday, said people familiar with the firm. Stockholm-based Lynx Asset Management\\'s diversified trend-following strategy, the Lynx Program, also lost roughly 10% for the period. Rob Christian, investment chief at K2 Advisors, a Franklin Templeton unit that invests more than $10 billion of client money in hedge funds, said some giveback of outsize gains was to be expected for trend followers, officially known as commodity trading advisers. \"I always tell people you have to have an iron stomach to invest in CTAs,\" he said. A rare fund that profited is $1 billion Key Square Capital Management, based in Greenwich, Conn. In a March 13 investor letter, founder Scott Bessent, a former investment chief for George Soros, wrote that Key Square the prior week had increased its funds\\' exposures to gold and haven currencies, shorted bank stocks and pulled back on energy exposure. Mr. Bessent since late last year had warned his clients that banks could face losses in their fixed-income and structured-products portfolios. A person familiar with the firm said Key Square\\'s main hedge fund was up 2.5% for the month through Friday. Another fund employing more leverage had gained 5%.',\n",
       "  'TOKYO -- Toshiba Corp. said it agreed to a $15 billion deal to take the company private, a move that would end years of conflict with foreign shareholders and put the company under full Japanese control. Toshiba said the buyout would be led by Japan Industrial Partners Inc., a Tokyo-based investment fund, and would include 17 domestic companies and six banks. A former leader of Japan\\'s corporate world, Toshiba has gone through eight years of turmoil that started with an accounting scandal in 2015 and included the 2017 bankruptcy filing by its U.S. nuclear subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric Co. It has sold many of the businesses that made it a well-known name globally, including laptop computers, televisions and medical equipment. Its remaining businesses include energy systems, batteries and air conditioners. Toshiba has been under strong pressure from overseas investors to consider privatization. Foreign investors took a bigger role in 2017 when they injected billions of dollars to improve Toshiba\\'s balance sheet. However, the buyout offer price is well below what those investors thought they could get a year or two ago, when the stock market was giving higher valuations to semiconductor manufacturers and other technology businesses in which Toshiba is active. Toshiba said the buyers were offering 4,620 yen a share, about 10% above the closing price of 4,213 yen in Tokyo Stock Exchange trading Thursday. That values the company at about 2 trillion yen, equivalent to $15 billion. The offer price was lower than the 5,000 yen a share CVC Capital Partners was informally offering in April 2021 -- a price that some Toshiba shareholders at the time said was too low. That potential deal fell apart as Toshiba said CVC\\'s proposal lacked details. For the nine months to December, Toshiba reported its net profit dropped 27% to the equivalent of about $640 million. Toshiba said the buyout group led by Japan Industrial Partners repeatedly lowered its offer price in recent months as market conditions and Toshiba\\'s business performance worsened. It said this situation \"is not something to instigate doubts about the fairness of the negotiation process\" and doesn\\'t refute the board\\'s position that it exerted itself to get the best possible deal for shareholders. Toshiba said that while the board unanimously agreed to accept the buyout proposal, the price wasn\\'t high enough to make an immediate recommendation to shareholders on whether they should sell their shares to the buyout group. It said a special committee would discuss whether to make a recommendation to shareholders. One of Toshiba\\'s main assets is the stake it retained in its memory-chip business after it sold majority control in 2018. That business, now a company called Kioxia Holdings Corp., had planned an initial public offering that would have been a lucrative opportunity for Toshiba to cash out, but Kioxia put off the IPO after a chip shortage turned into a glut. In March 2022, Toshiba shareholders rejected a management plan to split the company into two parts, reflecting opposition from foreign shareholders including some that wanted the company to be auctioned to the highest bidder. The next month Toshiba put itself up for auction. Seeking to bring foreign shareholders into the auction process, Toshiba added representatives from major U.S.-based shareholders Elliott Management Corp. and Farallon Capital Management LLC to its board. Toshiba received multiple buyout proposals, but it said Japan Industrial Partners was the only bidder with a detailed and workable plan. It said the formal takeover offer was expected to begin in late July pending approval for the acquisition under global competition laws. It said the offer would succeed if more than two-thirds of shareholders agree to sell their shares.',\n",
       "  'With Washington and Beijing embroiled in an intensifying great-power competition, multinational companies increasingly find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Ahead of this weekend\\'s China Development Forum in Beijing, the mood among the more than 50 chief executives and other senior executives from the U.S. and other countries expected to attend the high-level conference was a mix of anxiety and caution, said people close to the event. Their apprehension reflects the further deterioration of a relationship that for years has been mutually beneficial: that between Beijing and multinationals. For U.S. executives, the stakes of being seen hobnobbing in Beijing are extra high as Washington-Beijing ties fray ever further and just days after U.S. lawmakers pummeled the CEO of Chinese-owned TikTok about potential Chinese government influence on the platform. For many executives, though, the forum is the first opportunity to check out their China operations since Beijing ended nearly three years of Covid-19 isolation —and to get face time with the new Communist Party leadership recently installed under third-term leader Xi Jinping. Against the backdrop of increased animosity, though, many corporate participants in the China forum plan to keep a low profile, the people close to the event said. According to a list compiled by the forum\\'s organizers and viewed by The Wall Street Journal, the expected attendees include tech-giant chief executives Tim Cook of Apple Inc. and Cristiano Amon of Qualcomm Inc., and such consumer-goods and pharmaceuticals CEOs as Johnson & Johnson\\'s Joaquin Duato, Pfizer Inc.\\'s Albert Bourla, Procter & Gamble Co.\\'s Jon Moeller and Abbott Laboratories\\' Robert Ford. Ola Källenius, chairman of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, and Oliver Zipse, chairman of BMW AG, are also on the list. So are CEOs of energy companies including Wael Sawan of Shell PLC, Gary Nagle of Glencore PLC and Jakob Stausholm of Rio Tinto PLC. The expected attendance of Messrs. Cook, Bourla and Källenius were previously reported by The Wall Street Journal. Representatives for the companies declined to comment or didn\\'t respond to requests for comment. The organizer of the conference didn\\'t immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing has been holding the China Development Forum annually since 2000 to bring together global business elites and the country\\'s policy makers and to attract and keep foreign investment. During the U.S.-China trade war, Beijing used the forum to encourage corporate participants to lobby Washington on its behalf. This year\\'s forum, to be held at its usual venue of the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, comes as Washington steps up sanctions against Chinese companies and Beijing increases pressure on multinationals to not cross any lines that clash with Chinese positions, such as by declining to use cotton from the Xinjiang region —where the U.S. says Muslims are forced to work in internment camps. China has denied forced-labor practices. Some attending this year\\'s forum are scheduled to meet with Li Qiang, the newly appointed Chinese premier, at the Great Hall of the People on Monday afternoon. An unidentified vice premier is expected to give a keynote address on Sunday, according to the forum\\'s schedule viewed by the Journal. Most if not all of the Western corporate participants plan to avoid public engagements for fear of saying anything that might offend either Beijing or Washington, the people close to the event said. \"Trying to get lost in the crowd is not a bad approach,\" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, who will be attending the forum. But Mr. Kennedy said he expects many CEOs to privately impress upon the Chinese officials that \"the risks for Western firms of operating in China are higher than ever.\" Relations between the U.S. and China, the world\\'s leading economic powers, are already strained over trade, Taiwan, technology and geopolitical rivalries. On Thursday, TikTok landed in the middle of it as U.S. lawmakers leveled withering attacks at the app\\'s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, in a hearing that lasted more than five hours. The Biden administration has threatened to ban the app if ByteDance Ltd., its Chinese owner, doesn\\'t sell its holdings. Hours before Mr. Chew\\'s hearing, Beijing said it opposes a TikTok sale . More Western companies are reassessing their operations in China as tensions between Beijing and Washington rise. In addition, China\\'s nearly three years of draconian Covid-19 restrictions, followed by a sudden and chaotic dismantling of the curbs late in 2022, disrupted supplies of goods from a country known as the world\\'s factory floor. In a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China of 319 of its members, only 45% of respondents said they regard China as their primary or among their top three investment destinations , down from 59% in 2019. Some senior economic officials in Beijing have also grown worried about losing foreign investors as the government is trying to reboot an economy battered by the China\\'s self-imposed Covid-19 isolation . For instance, Liu He, until recently Mr. Xi\\'s right-hand economic czar, expressed such concerns to some Western executives at the World Economic Forum\\'s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in January. Also on the list of those attending this year\\'s China forum are Ray Dalio, founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates; Howard Marks, co-chairman of distressed-debt manager Oaktree Capital; and Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara, CEO of Singaporean sovereign-wealth fund Temasek Holdings. Bridgewater and Oaktree didn\\'t respond to a request for comment. A Temasek spokesperson confirmed its CEO\\'s attendance. \"As an institution, we take part in forums globally for insights on the latest developments, and to exchange views with other investors and stakeholders,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. While expressing desire to keep attracting foreign investment, Beijing has appeared to continue its pressure on multinationals. Earlier this month, for instance, it suspended the operations of Deloitte\\'s Beijing office for three months and imposed an unprecedented fine, totaling about $31 million, over alleged lapses in its auditing work of state-owned China Huarong Asset Management Co. By comparison, Huarong itself and seven of its subsidiaries were fined about $14,500 each. Deloitte said it respected the penalty decision. Sharon Thorne, global board chair of Deloitte, is listed as a participant in the China forum.',\n",
       "  'WASHINGTON -- U.S.-China relations were rocked again Thursday as House lawmakers pummeled TikTok\\'s chief executive over the popular app\\'s ties to China, and as Beijing said it would fight any U.S. attempt to force the company\\'s sale by its Chinese owners. The congressional hearing, peppered with withering attacks on TikTok from both Democrats and Republicans, ran more than five hours and underscored increasing concerns over Beijing\\'s potential influence over the app. It comes as relations between the U.S. and China are frayed over trade, Taiwan, technology and geopolitical rivalries. TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew, seated in front of U.S. TikTok executives and popular stars on the platform, sought to reassure lawmakers that TikTok would earn their trust. \"Our approach has never been to dismiss or trivialize any of these concerns. We have addressed them with real action,\" he said. Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, gave a blunt response to Mr. Chew\\'s claims. \"I don\\'t buy it,\" Mr. Pallone said. The committee\\'s Republican chairwoman, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, called for banning the app, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. The bipartisan skepticism further clouded the future of a platform that TikTok has said is used by 150 million people in the U.S. Hours before the hearing, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would \"firmly oppose\" the Biden administration\\'s recent demand that TikTok\\'s Chinese owners sell their stakes or face a ban. U.S. lawmakers pointed to that statement as evidence that the company was beholden to Beijing. TikTok\\'s travails have put it at the center of fraying ties between the world\\'s two great economic powers as they quarrel over trade policy, surveillance, technological development and more. Washington stepped up sanctions against Chinese companies and Beijing deployed regulatory enforcement and other pressure tactics against U.S. businesses. The resulting trade blacklists have swept up China-based telecommunications companies Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., as well as U.S. defense contractors Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Technologies Corp. \"The TikTok battles are indicative of the end of an era,\" said Lindsay Gorman, senior fellow for emerging technologies at the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, and a former Biden White House adviser. \"This era where U.S.-China business relations can continue absent considerations of geopolitics is over.\" The U.S.\\'s concerns over TikTok partly stem from increased involvement in business activities by the Chinese government. Under President Xi Jinping, China\\'s party-state adopted laws and regulations to ensure its access to data collected by private firms and expanded efforts to influence corporate governance and decision making. China blocked U.S. social media and information sites including Alphabet Inc.\\'s Google and Meta Platforms Inc.\\'s Facebook. A fund backed by China\\'s cybersecurity watchdog holds a 1% stake in the core subsidiary of TikTok\\'s Chinese parent, ByteDance, a so-called golden share that gives the regulator a board seat at the subsidiary, voting power and sway over its business decisions. Under questioning from Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R., Texas), Mr. Chew said that under the company\\'s security plan, TikTok\\'s data would be stored in the U.S. and controlled by a U.S. company. Mr. Crenshaw responded: \"I want to say this to all the teenagers out there and TikTok influencers who think we\\'re just old and out of touch and . . . . trying to take away your favorite app. You may not care that your data is being accessed now, but it will be one day when you do care about it.\" Mrs. Rodgers opened the questioning Thursday by asking Mr. Chew to state \"with 100% certainty\" that the Chinese government couldn\\'t use TikTok or its parent company, ByteDance, to surveil Americans or manipulate the content Americans see. Mr. Chew said TikTok is committed to firewalling U.S. user data from \"all unwanted foreign access\" and would keep content \"free from any manipulation from any government.\" \"If you can\\'t say it 100% certain, I take that as a \\'no,\\'\" Mrs. Rodgers shot back. \"I have zero confidence in your assertion that ByteDance and TikTok are not beholden\" to the Chinese Communist Party. In his testimony, Mr. Chew said TikTok is spending $1.5 billion to create the firewall, leaving \"American data stored on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel.\" When that process is complete, he said, it should eliminate lawmakers\\' concern that some TikTok user data could be subject to Chinese law -- though he said engineers globally could access it as required for business purposes. Asked about a possible sale, Mr. Chew said he doesn\\'t think a change in ownership would improve safety and security, pointing to the privacy problems of U.S. tech platforms. He said the platform would work to ensure a safe environment for young people, another concern of committee members. Rep. Bob Latta (R., Ohio) said TikTok had been insulated from legal claims arising from the death of a 10-year-old girl who participated in a breath-holding challenge that was popular on TikTok. Mr. Latta questioned why TikTok should be protected by federal law shielding websites when it amplifies \"dangerous and life-threatening content to children.\" Mr. Chew said the platform has taken a number of proactive steps to better protect children -- including measures that go beyond those employed by other platforms. For example, accounts registered to teens under 16 are set to private by default, and they can\\'t send direct messages. Their content is ineligible for recommendation in the app\\'s popular \"For You\" tab. He said dealing with harmful content was an industrywide challenge. Some lawmakers asked Mr. Chew if he agreed that China\\'s government has persecuted the Uyghur ethnic group, which U.S. officials have characterized as a genocide. Mr. Chew answered by saying content about that issue was available on TikTok. After the hearing ended, TikTok spokeswoman Brooke Oberwetter said in a statement that political grandstanding had dominated the hearing, ignoring the solutions TikTok was working on to protect user data and keep content harmful to young people off the site. The hearing shed little light on how Congress might address the numerous problems with TikTok that lawmakers highlighted. Several bills are under consideration in Congress that would ban TikTok outright, typically by banning U.S. companies from doing business with it. Some would allow the government to ban or restrict other apps with ties to hostile foreign governments. Several lawmakers urged renewed consideration of comprehensive privacy legislation. A ban on TikTok faces practical and legal hurdles, and two federal judges struck down former President Donald Trump\\'s earlier attempts to do so. Any crackdown carries political risks, particularly for Democrats who tend to get more support from the younger people who are TikTok\\'s dominant audience. --- Lingling Wei, Stu Woo, Grace Zhu and Raffaele Huang contributed to this article.',\n",
       "  'Electric vehicles are taking General Motors Co.\\'s cyber chief into new territory. Kevin Tierney, the auto maker\\'s chief cybersecurity officer, often finds himself monitoring risks across information-technology systems, autonomous vehicles and manufacturing plants. Now, he\\'s adding power-grid security to his day-to-day work. His added brief is mostly due to the sweeping shift away from gas-powered cars. California, among several states, has mandated zero-emission vehicles by 2035, and GM is significantly upgrading its EV production capacity, including with a $650 million investment in Lithium Americas Corp. as part of a plan to develop a mine in Nevada and secure access to a mineral key to the batteries used in EVs. The company plans to release several new electric models this year, and aims to install thousands of charging stations across the U.S. by 2025. \"We\\'re moving, really, from just being a vehicle manufacturer to a vehicle manufacturer and infrastructure provider,\" Mr. Tierney said. That, in turn, creates new cyber risks. Research funded by the Energy Department, published in July, found that hackers could use vulnerable security at charging stations to skim credit-card details and even hijack entire charging networks. Hackers have shown a willingness to target the U.S. power grid, and a string of physical attacks have also disrupted operations. The cyber vulnerabilities of EV and energy security have gained attention in Washington. In October, the Office of the National Cyber Director held a meeting on the subject of EV security. The U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources hosted a hearing Thursday on cybersecurity in the energy sector. On Tuesday, Mr. Tierney was appointed to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s cybersecurity advisory committee, a group of private-sector specialists from companies across critical infrastructure operators that advises CISA Director Jen Easterly. Mr. Tierney said public-private partnerships designed to draw on specialists across sectors will be critical. Given that GM\\'s operations cross into advanced manufacturing, transportation and now energy distribution, he said, cyber resilience means companies need to cooperate on core issues. \"I think we have to figure out a little bit better, across sectors, where our touch points are and where we can make our forces more cumulative, instead of maybe doing the same things over and over again,\" he said.',\n",
       "  'WASHINGTON -- Top progressive Democrats said they have disagreements with President Biden but remain staunch supporters headed into the 2024 election, after moves by the administration on issues such as crime, immigration and energy policy angered the party\\'s left wing. Mr. Biden sided with Republicans on overturning Washington, D.C.\\'s crime code, prompting howls from progressives for stepping on home rule, and the White House has drawn scrutiny for considering a return to a policy of detaining migrant families who cross illegally into the U.S. The administration also approved the Willow oil-drilling project in the Alaskan Arctic over the objections of environmentalists. Progressive lawmakers and activists criticized the moves, but the blowback has been limited. No major protests have emerged outside the White House, and there has been no talk of a serious primary challenger from the progressive flank. Many see Mr. Biden as critical to winning the coming presidential race and helping take back full control of Congress, even if they aren\\'t always on the same page. \"I\\'m opposed to the Willow project, which will mean fossil-fuel drilling on federal land, and I do think the president will need to have a bold climate policy to mobilize young voters in 2024,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), a progressive who is considering running for Senate next year. Still, on the presidential race, Mr. Khanna said: \"I\\'ll be backing him enthusiastically.\" Progressives have been the loudest voices within the party on matters including policing, LGBT issues, economic opportunity and protecting the environment. Mr. Biden ran in 2020 as a seasoned centrist but has worked with progressives on many of their priorities -- including passing a bill designed to slow climate change and taking executive action to trim student loans. \"It\\'s no secret that the president wasn\\'t my first choice in 2020,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.) who leads the House progressives. But after working together she plans to support him in 2024. She said progressives will continue to \"push where we need to push.\" A recent NBC/PBS NewsHour poll said that 50% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents think Democrats have a better chance of winning the White House if Mr. Biden is the nominee, compared with 45% who think the party would do better with someone else. Mr. Biden is expected to formally announce he is running later this year. The White House said it is in regular touch with progressive leaders on Capitol Hill. With House Democrats now in the minority, progressives are pressuring Mr. Biden to take more executive actions, bypassing Congress. Staff for the Congressional Progressive Caucus met with the White House\\'s Office of Legislative Affairs on Tuesday to talk about their wish list, which includes a range of demands, from expanding worker overtime protections to declaring a national climate emergency. Last year, progressives pressed Mr. Biden to cancel student loan debt. Ultimately Mr. Biden issued an executive order to cancel up to $20,000 in debt, short of what some progressives wanted. The Supreme Court is expected to decide the fate of the program by late June. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) both ran against Mr. Biden in the 2020 Democratic primary, proposing student-loan forgiveness and expanded government health coverage. They now back Mr. Biden if he seeks another term. \"I think what the progressive movement in the country has done is to show the political establishment that millions of people are tired of status quo politics,\" said Mr. Sanders. \"Is he doing everything that I would like? No, but I think he has heard that message,\" he said. \"I thought they were wrong,\" Ms. Warren said of the president\\'s recent moves on immigration, drilling and crime, while praising his actions on climate and corporate taxes. \"Joe Biden and I don\\'t agree on everything, but I\\'m really glad he\\'s president of the U.S.,\" she said on NBC News. The White House cited Mr. Biden\\'s recently released budget, which proposes child care, paid leave and free community college, as showing shared goals. But the White House is also trying to take a tough line on issues such as crime and illegal immigration that Republicans make clear will be a focus in 2024.',\n",
       "  'Virginia-based power company AES Corp. says it is ready to push the button on a solar-panel order of more than $1 billion if a manufacturer will commit to building a factory in the U.S. If that factory gets built, AES can buy its panels and apply for federal subsidies recently made available to clean-energy developers that use equipment made in the U.S. There is one problem: The government hasn\\'t decided what \"made in the U.S.\" means, and how strictly to define it. \"You can\\'t sign on the dotted line until this is clarified,\" said Andres Gluski, AES\\'s chief executive. The company and two other developers have said they would collectively buy as much as $6 billion in panels from a manufacturer that sets up in the U.S. Just what qualifies as made in America is one of the biggest questions still hanging over the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed in August that offers hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits and other incentives for clean-energy projects. The issue is more complicated than it might seem, given that almost all clean-energy projects require at least some parts that are manufactured overseas. The law is supposed to spur not only the deployment of clean energy but also the creation of domestic jobs and industries to underpin that rollout. So lawmakers sprinkled support for U.S.-made products throughout the legislation -- from rebates for buying electric vehicles that contain significant domestic content to bonus tax credits for solar or wind developers that use enough U.S.-manufactured equipment. \"If we\\'re going to use federal tax dollars, we\\'re going to direct that investment into the United States and create American jobs,\" said John Podesta, senior adviser to President Biden for clean-energy innovation and implementation, at a Houston energy conference in early March. \"We\\'ve for too long let our supply chains drift overseas, particularly to China.\" As much as half of potentially $500 billion-plus in investment generated by the Inflation Reduction Act\\'s incentives include some sort of domestic-content requirements or bonus, according to an analysis by research institute Rhodium Group. The money at stake has made defining what it would take to meet those requirements one of the most hotly contested aspects of the law, spurring complaints from governments as well as tussles among companies ranging from U.S. steelmaker Nucor Corp. to power company NextEra Energy Inc. -- all of which are angling for as much of the green subsidies as possible. The details are being completed by the Treasury Department and are expected to come out over the next few months. The rules on one important incentive -- a $7,500 tax rebate for electric-vehicle purchases, if the cars and their batteries meet domestic content and sourcing requirements -- are expected by the end of this month. Meanwhile, many would-be investors are hanging back. In solar, wind and storage projects alone, about $20 billion in investment could be on hold while the government sorts out a variety of tax-credit details, say clean-energy analysts. A big challenge is that much of the manufacturing the law is trying to spur barely exists in the U.S. today, from the silicon ingots and special glass needed for solar panels to the large steel plates for offshore wind arrays. The bulk of those products and components are instead imported from overseas, particularly China. Defining \"made in America\" in a way that excludes most of those imports could mean nobody would meet domestic-content requirements, some green-energy developers say. Take solar projects, which under the legislation could in some cases receive 10% more in bonus tax credits if enough of the equipment by value is made domestically. That incentive has sparked a furious debate over solar panels, which alone can comprise 40% of the total equipment cost of a solar plant and are crucial to getting the bonus. Companies such as NextEra, the U.S.\\'s biggest developer of solar projects, are urging that panels assembled in the U.S. be considered American-made, even if the ingredients come from overseas. Such a definition would let more developers get bonus credits and encourage the construction of more solar farms, they reason. Companies such as South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group\\'s Qcells unit, which is planning a U.S. factory, disagree. A solar panel shouldn\\'t be defined as U.S.-made if its most important pieces are made overseas, Hanwha said.',\n",
       "  'CAIRO -- After years of underinvestment in North Africa\\'s energy infrastructure, global oil-and-gas giants from Halliburton Co. and Chevron Corp. to Eni SpA are ramping up their presence in the region as demand from Europe grows. Executives in the industry are betting it is worth drilling again in some of the hardest places to do business in the world as Europe increasingly turns to other sources for its energy needs after shunning its main supplier, Russia, over the invasion of Ukraine. In recent months, a string of European officials have visited the region to help advance talks over potential supply deals. Halliburton and Honeywell International Inc. are hammering out $1.4 billion worth of deals to develop an oil field and refinery with National Oil Corporation in Libya, which has the largest known oil reserves in Africa, according to the chairman of the state-owned firm, Farhat Bengdara. Italy\\'s Eni is planning investments aimed at replacing nearly half of the gas it was importing from Russia with gas from Algeria. Chevron is looking to seal an energy exploration deal in Algeria, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. In January, the U.S. oil major announced a sizable natural-gas discovery in Egypt. \"North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,\" said Geoff Porter, president of U.S.-based North Africa Risk Consulting Inc. But with Europe needing to replace Russian energy, \"this is their moment,\" he said. Western oil executives say they see a more stable political climate in North Africa, especially in countries such as Libya, where fighting between local militias has been subdued in the past two years following nearly a decade of civil war. Many U.S. firms had pulled back from the region, viewing it as politically too risky, to focus on shale production at home. The region\\'s proximity to Europe and massive reserves, with Algeria holding the third-largest recoverable shale resources in the world, also make doing business there worth the risk, they say. At the same time, state-owned firms in the North African region have been eager to strike deals, as they see an opportunity to fill a gap left by Russia and take advantage of higher global commodity prices. Some countries, such as Egypt, are eager to bring in additional revenue from selling energy, as their economies struggle with higher import costs including for food. The Ukraine war has disrupted shipments and pushed up global commodity prices. The Libyan state-owned company is expected to soon sign a $1 billion agreement with Halliburton that will allow the U.S. firm to rebuild the al-Dhara oil field, according to Mr. Bengdara. The oil field in central Libya was destroyed by Islamic State militants in 2015 and is now run by ConocoPhillips and TotalEnergies SE, he said. It would be one of the biggest deals for the U.S. oil-services giant clinched in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years. Halliburton and Total didn\\'t respond to requests to comment. ConocoPhillips declined to comment. Libya\\'s NOC and Honeywell are set to unveil a contract related to the construction of a refinery in southern Libya, Mr. Bengdara and a spokesman for the American firm said. The initial deal, expected to be announced this weekend, is for the design of the plant, the spokesman said, which would be followed by a $400 million pact to build the entire plant. Libya relies heavily on its oil resources for income, although it has struggled for years to turn its own crude into motor fuel, making it largely dependent on costly gasoline imports. --- William Mauldin contributed to this article.',\n",
       "  'When Yolett McPhee-McCuin saw the Mississippi women\\'s basketball coaching job was open in 2018, she didn\\'t wait for a call. She reached out to the school\\'s search firm and sold herself. \"I\\'m hot,\" she said. \"And y\\'all could get me for cheap.\" McPhee-McCuin had turned around Jacksonville University\\'s team from several losing seasons to 24-9. Ole Miss had little to lose, having won exactly one Southeastern Conference game the season before. Five years later, McPhee-McCuin and her No. 8-seeded Rebels engineered one of the NCAA women\\'s tournament\\'s biggest upsets, beating perennial power and No. 1 seed Stanford on Sunday. The Rebels face No. 5 Louisville on Friday in the Sweet 16. While women\\'s college basketball has been dominated by dynastic coaches or those who\\'ve played in the Olympics, McPhee-McCuin is \"out of the mud,\" she said. She grew up in the Caribbean nation of the Bahamas, whose entire national population of 408,000 wouldn\\'t quite fill the stands over an eight-game home season of Ole Miss football. McPhee-McCuin had an unremarkable college career -- Miami-Dade Community College, followed by Rhode Island -- then clambered up a splintery coaching ladder to become the reigning NCAA women\\'s tournament darling. McPhee-McCuin\\'s route included crisscrossing the U.S. to unglamorous assistant jobs: a junior college in the Texas panhandle city of Borger, nicknamed \"Booger Town\"; Arkansas-Pine Bluff; the University of Portland (Ore.); Pittsburgh; and Clemson before landing her first head coaching job, at Jacksonville. \"I always use, like, basketball analogies, and I say: For my life, y\\'all, I never get a wide-open layup,\" McPhee-McCuin said. \"I always have to do a pro-hop or a Euro step to score in life.\" Coach Yo, as she\\'s known, had a knack for connecting with people, though -- precious currency in the player recruitment that drives college basketball. She told the Coach JB Show podcast this week: \"I don\\'t know that I\\'m ever going to be googly-eyes over the McDonald\\'s All-American. Give me the Wendy\\'s All-American all day, every day.\" It was a journey to an actual fast-food restaurant that helped land one of her most important recruits. Kayla Gordon, a standout at Meridian (Miss.) High in the early 2010s, recalled that she was a homebody with no interest in leaving the state. But Coach Yo wanted her on the team in Jacksonville, about an eight-hour drive away. So one day, McPhee-McCuin surprised Gordon by walking into the Chick-fil-A where she worked. As the two chatted, Gordon said she marveled at the steps McPhee-McCuin had taken: Calling her mom to find out when she was working, making the trip, showing up and showing Gordon how much she valued her. \"I\\'m like, \\'Wow, I feel special,\\'\" Gordon recalled. Gordon played four years at Jacksonville, leading the team in rebounding her senior year. After school she took two more leaps inspired by Coach Yo: The former homebody went to Europe, playing professionally in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Finland. And Gordon went into coaching. She\\'s now an assistant women\\'s basketball coach at Jacksonville. Ross Bjork, the Ole Miss athletic director in 2018, said that Coach Yo was on Mississippi\\'s list of potential women\\'s basketball coaches -- a list 25 people long. As he interviewed candidates, said Bjork, now Texas A&M\\'s athletic director, a representative of the search firm hired by the school reminded him, \"Hey, don\\'t forget about Coach Yo.\" That representative, now TurnkeyZRG managing director Chad Chatlos, said McPhee-McCuin was, \"just was like a bulldog: \\'Put me in front of the AD. I won\\'t let you down.\\' Yolett just had this perfect blend of being aggressive but being respectful of the process.\" Bjork and an Ole Miss colleague finally set up a FaceTime call with McPhee-McCuin and, Bjork said, \"She, like, jumped through the screen with her energy and passion.\" Coach Yo was also fearless, something he needed in a coach coming into a tough conference for a rebuilding job. McPhee-McCuin muddled through two rough seasons -- 9-22, 7-23 -- before pushing Ole Miss above .500 in 2021, then to the NCAA tournament\\'s first round in 2022. This season, the Rebels narrowly lost against SEC power LSU and defending NCAA champion South Carolina. Then came the second-round NCAA upset of Stanford and a spontaneous celebration by all the people who\\'ve been in Coach Yo\\'s orbit. The Bahamas Basketball Federation, for which McPhee-McCuin has coached the women\\'s national team and assisted in coaching the men\\'s team, congratulated her on its social-media sites. College football talk-show king Paul Finebaum had her on. Fellow Bahamian and WNBA star Jonquel Jones of the New York Liberty tweeted a video of herself dancing and saying, \"We just knocked out a No. 1 seed!\" Jones later explained in an interview: \"The Bahamas is a small country, so it\\'s \\'we.\\' We take our wins wherever we can get them.\" Jones -- a four-time WNBA All-Star and the 2021 league MVP -- said that McPhee-McCuin\\'s father, a legendary high school coach named Gladstone \"Moon\" McPhee, \"basically taught me everything I know about basketball.\" There were few games or tournaments for girls in the Bahamas, Jones said, so players had to fit into boys\\' schedules or train by themselves. As a teenager Yolett woke her father at 5 a.m. each weekday and they would head to an outdoor court to get a workout in. Then she would go home to clean up in time for her mother, Daisy, who was also the school principal, to unlock the school gates at 7 a.m., according to the Mississippi Clarion-Ledger. The Rebels took down Stanford the old-school way: with defense and free throws. Ole Miss forward Madison Scott recalled that Coach Yo had said the key to beating the Cardinal on their court -- the women\\'s tournament awards higher-seeded teams with early-round home games -- was improving on the Rebels\\' shooting from the line, a dismal 67.3% this season. \"Before we left, we were in Oxford (Miss.) shooting free throws every day before practice, after practice,\" Scott said. It paid off: Ole Miss made 11 of 14 free throws against Stanford. The Rebels won, 54-49.',\n",
       "  'The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has triggered a debate over the best way to support unprofitable businesses that are developing new technologies. When it comes to innovations aimed at climate change, some say government agencies should play a bigger role. Before regulators took over Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, it stood out as a lender to clean-energy companies such as residential-solar providers and fuel-cell makers, as well as developers of climate-related technologies like low-carbon cement. The bank\\'s loans to startups pale in comparison to the more than $1 trillion invested in such businesses by venture-capital firms during the past few years, according to research provider PitchBook Data Inc. The lender, however, provided an alternative to more expensive and dilutive equity capital, according to investment bankers serving the industry. \"For better or for worse, they played a unique role in the venture-financing space,\" said Jeremy Swan, a managing principal with advisory firm CohnReznick LLP. Silicon Valley Bank\\'s status as a federally insured depository institution has raised the question of whether it assumed too much risk by lending to early-stage and unprofitable startups. With largely unproven products, these companies often lack assets to pledge against a loan and rely on cash from venture investors, creating a mismatch between risk and return for a bank lender, said Bob Bartell, president of risk and financial consulting firm Kroll LLC\\'s corporate finance business. \"It is pretty uncommon for a [commercial] bank to make a loan to an unprofitable business if it is not collateralized by a personal guarantee of a business owner or a corporate guarantee of a larger parent company,\" Mr. Bartell said. Lending without tangible collateral means \"taking equity risk and getting paid debt returns,\" he said. Government agencies, on the other hand, can represent a more suitable source of low-cost capital to risky businesses because the support they provide usually doesn\\'t depend on profits, Arij van Berkel, a senior vice president of Lux Research Inc., said in a webinar hosted by the consulting firm. \"A government, or a government-affiliated organization, [has] other motives for taking a high risk,\" he said. \"For example, they want to meet climate goals or they want to turn their economy into a circular economy.\" Federal agencies provide seed capital that helps entrepreneurs start new businesses.

The recently added government incentives for clean energy didn\\'t focus on early-stage startups, but the situation could change as reducing carbon emissions becomes a more pressing goal, Anthony Schiavo, a research director at Lux, said during the webinar. He said that more nondilutive, direct funding from government sources could encourage venture-capital firms to back less profitable businesses and change their traditional method of building portfolios with the idea of producing one or two very profitable startups to offset many failures. \"The VC goal or playbook was to invest in a lot of companies with the explicit outcome of trying to get to a billion-dollar startup,\" he said. \"I think [this model] is not very good for the sustainable-innovation space. In general, we need some of these technologies to work. We need to decarbonize a bunch of different sectors.\" Ms. Hansen said venture-capital firms turned down her investment pitches many times, telling her Onboard wouldn\\'t produce the return multiples of 10- or 30-times invested capital in the period that they wanted. It\\'s often hard for developers of clean-energy equipment to deliver such returns because these businesses require a large amount of capital, she said. \"We need patient capital that\\'s willing to tolerate lower returns,\" Ms. Hansen said. \"It\\'s hardware that\\'s going to solve the climate problem. It\\'s not software. It\\'s not an app.\"',\n",
       "  'A federal judge curbed Puerto Rico bondholders\\' rights to the electric revenue generated by its public power utility, the last major public corporation in the U.S. territory still in bankruptcy after its other public debts were restructured. Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled on Wednesday that utility bondholders\\' collateral rights don\\'t extend to the current and future revenue of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa. Bondholders were deemed to have a security interest only in certain funds in Prepa\\'s reserve accounts, which represent a fraction of their claims. Judge Swain said that bondholders have only an unsecured claim to the utility\\'s future net revenue, or its excess funds after operating expenses are paid. Further proceedings are needed to value that unsecured claim, which covers the future revenue that would have become payable to bondholders over the life of Prepa\\'s $8.3 billion in municipal debt, according to the decision. Wednesday\\'s ruling grants some legal leverage to the oversight board steering Puerto Rico\\'s finances as it tries to lift the power utility out of a bankruptcy case that began in 2017. The oversight board spokesman said Wednesday it welcomed the decision as \"a significant win for Puerto Rico and its path to reliable electricity and economic growth.\" \"The oversight board is still analyzing the decision in detail to determine the implications of bondholders\\' remaining claim but will continue to work on resolving the remaining issues of Prepa\\'s debt restructuring consensually,\" the spokesman said. A spokesman for Prepa bondholders declined to comment. A bondholder group had argued in court that its security interest covered the full principal and interest amounts due on their bonds and extended to Prepa\\'s current and future net revenue. Bank lenders owed $700 million and a single bond insurer, MBIA Inc., agreed to restructuring terms for Prepa, but most bondholders haven\\'t. The oversight board has offered a baseline recovery of 50 cents on the dollar to bondholders in the form of cash and new securities, or less than that if they litigate their security interests and lose. The restructuring terms will determine how much 1.5 million residential and business customers will pay for electricity, which costs more in Puerto Rico than in any U.S. state. Energy bills are already a drain on family incomes and quality of life in Puerto Rico and are expected to increase to pay for any long-term settlement of Prepa\\'s debts. The oversight board and bondholders disagreed on how much of a rate increase customers can afford, especially those with lower incomes. Bondholders have argued that Prepa has a history of underestimating its projected sales and of viewing temporary challenges, such as the rise in oil prices, as permanent in order to drive down creditors\\' claims.',\n",
       "  'DUBAI—Saudi Arabia and Syria are nearing an agreement to restore diplomatic ties after negotiations mediated by Russia, according to Saudi and Syrian officials familiar with the discussions, as the geopolitics of the Middle East shift. Talks were continuing after rounds of discussions in Moscow and Riyadh in recent weeks, the officials said. If a deal is reached, it would mark an important step to reintegrating Syria and its leader Bashar al-Assad into the broader region after a brutal civil war . Following the Chinese-brokered deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran on resuming ties this month, the emerging Damascus-Riyadh rapprochement, if it sticks, would leave the U.S. on the sidelines again on another major Middle East development . Saudi and Syrian officials said negotiators are aiming to conclude a deal before a potential visit by Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan to Damascus after the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr in late April. But they cautioned that the discussions could still break down. Saudi state television reported Thursday night that negotiations have started with Syria to resume offering necessary consular services for both countries, citing a source at the foreign ministry. Saudi Arabia and Syria cut ties in 2012 over Mr. Assad\\'s response to political protests that emerged from the Arab Spring uprising and his actions in the ensuing civil war. The Saudis helped orchestrate Syria\\'s ejection from the Arab League and funded rebels fighting Mr. Assad\\'s forces for years. The Russian government brokered a preliminary agreement when Mr. Assad visited Moscow last week, said officials from Saudi Arabia, Syria and other Arab countries involved. Senior Syrian officials then visited Saudi Arabia in recent weeks. If a formal agreement is reached, a vote on reintegration of Syria into the broader region and its reconstruction will be on the agenda of the next Arab League summit expected in May in Saudi Arabia, according to Arab officials. Much of the Arab world has moved to set aside the rivalries that plunged the region into chaos following uprisings that began in 2011 and toppled several Middle Eastern governments. Mr. Assad has been in talks with several Arab countries to end more than a decade of isolation, and the Saudi foreign minister recently said the status quo with Syria wasn\\'t sustainable. Iran also encouraged Syria to strike a deal with Saudi Arabia after Riyadh and Tehran agreed to resume diplomatic ties after a seven-year hiatus, said an Iranian official and Syrian government advisers. Other Arab countries such as Oman and Jordan have also backed the rapprochement between Damascus and Riyadh, said Arab officials familiar with the talks. The main focus of the talks has been security, Syrian government advisers said. The kingdom wants to resolve the issue of Saudi detainees who were captured after joining jihadist groups involved in the civil war, these people said. Damascus is seeking Riyadh\\'s help to cut off funding for and recruitment of fundamentalist factions fighting in Syria, the officials said. Any agreement between Saudi Arabia and Syria, brokered by Russia, would represent another splashy diplomatic move by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The 37-year-old who rules the oil-rich kingdom day-to-day for his aging father, King Salman, has reset relations with Washington , long the Saudi\\'s protector in the Persian Gulf, and developed closer relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping since the beginning of the Ukraine war. Prince Mohammed faced diplomatic isolation for several years after Saudi agents killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in an operation that the U.S. intelligence community concluded was ordered by the royal . The Saudi government says that Prince Mohammed wasn\\'t involved and that the perpetrators were brought to justice. Prince Mohammed has tried to avoid being pulled onto any one side since the start of the Ukraine war . He has used the war as an opportunity to forge an independent foreign policy that leverages Saudi Arabia\\'s status as the world\\'s largest oil exporter. The Syria talks come after Prince Mohammed greenlighted a detente with Iran in a deal brokered by China. \"Oil exporters and authoritarian states have more in common than the democratic West, with their use of sanctions and perceived hypocrisy on respect for sovereignty,\" said Karen Young, senior research scholar specializing in the Middle East at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. In the Middle East, she said, \"the general trend is a consensus on noninterference in domestic affairs as a principle.\" Mediating between Saudi Arabia and Syria bolsters Russia\\'s presence in the Middle East. Mr. Putin\\'s air-power intervention in the Syrian civil war proved decisive for Mr. Assad, and he has courted the Saudis, aligning oil-rich Russia with the Riyadh-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. For the U.S., the deal is a reminder that, while it remains the pre-eminent military and diplomatic force in the Middle East, its influence there is waning. The U.S. still has troops in Syria, where they are conducting antiterrorism operations in the country\\'s southeast and with Kurdish-led forces in the northeast. But Washington has long signaled that it wants to focus more on Russia and China and less on the region\\'s messy affairs, and the shift was illustrated Thursday when The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. will send aging attack planes to the Middle East and swap out the more advanced combat aircraft there now. \"The most important single factor affecting the region is the perception of American withdrawal, which creates a vacuum that other countries can step into,\" said William Wechsler, a former U.S. Defense Department official and now director of the Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs in Washington. The Middle East has undergone a dramatic realignment in recent years. The Saudis patched up a diplomatic spat with Qatar , Persian Gulf countries have begun setting aside longstanding differences with Turkey, and conflicts in Libya, Yemen and Syria have largely cooled down. The U.S. remains engaged in trying to broker a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia , but there are high hurdles. \"After the Saudi-Iran pact and now a prospective rapprochement between Syria and the kingdom, the U.S. is increasingly diplomatically sidelined,\" said Fabrice Balanche, a Middle East-focused assistant professor at the University of Lyon 2 in France. \"Middle East nations are making peace without Washington.\" For Mr. Assad, a deal with Saudi Arabia would be one of the final demonstrations that he prevailed in a grinding 11-year civil war, not just against the rebels but also against an array of foreign actors, including the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, who called for his removal from power. Mr. Assad used a devastating earthquake in his country\\'s north last month to make a push for normal diplomatic relations, visiting Oman and the United Arab Emirates in recent weeks. But he remains a pariah in most of the world, with overwhelming evidence that he used chemical weapons on Syrians and oversaw the killing of tens of thousands of civilians.',\n",
       "  'Facebook, Google, Snapchat and Pinterest have been unable to vanquish TikTok. Now their investors may be a bit too hopeful that the U.S. government will do it for them. Stocks of the parent companies of TikTok\\'s main U.S. rivals jumped Thursday as Shou Zi Chew—chief executive officer of the red-hot social-media app—was grilled before Congress over a host of issues that are mostly related to the company\\'s Chinese ownership. Mr. Chew\\'s appearance before the House Energy and Commerce Committee came after the Biden administration threatened earlier this month to ban the app if the company\\'s Chinese owners didn\\'t divest their ownership stakes. The Chinese government responded Thursday, saying it would oppose any forced sale on the grounds that it would involve exporting technology that would require government approval. That appeared to increase the likelihood of an outright ban, which would come as good news to the social-media and online advertising giants that have ceded market share to TikTok over the past couple of years as the app has exploded in popularity, now reaching more than 150 million active users in the U.S. Thursday\\'s hearing was further evidence that a social app purportedly used by nearly half the U.S. population doesn\\'t have any friends in Washington. Committee members from both political parties roundly voiced concerns about TikTok\\'s Chinese ownership and expressed strong skepticism of the company\\'s stated plan to hive off data on U.S. users with the help of Oracle. \"Your platform should be banned,\" said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the committee\\'s Republican chair. \"I still believe that the Beijing communist government will still control and have the ability to influence what you do,\" said Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the panel\\'s top Democrat. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Snapchat parent Snap, Google parent Alphabet and Pinterest have seen their stocks average a 10% gain since March 15, when The Wall Street Journal reported the threat from the Biden administration. That is more than twice the Nasdaq Composite\\'s gains in that time. Together with Amazon, those companies generated more than $380 billion in online advertising revenue last year. But that was up only 6% from the previous year—a notable slump from the 28% annual growth averaged over the previous five years. So the prospect of having a formidable competitor being taken out of circulation is heartening, especially in a market that isn\\'t expected to turn back up anytime soon. Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik estimates that TikTok is on track to generate between $7 billion and $8 billion in revenue in the U.S. alone next year. He named Meta and Alphabet, which also owns TikTok competitor YouTube, as the companies most likely to benefit from a TikTok ban, but added that \"some ad dollars may just go back into ad buyer pockets or look for an experimental platform outside our cohort.\" Experienced D.C. watchers say it is still far from certain whether such a ban can even be enacted—and if it will stick. \"We remain below 50% that TikTok is ultimately banned in the U.S.,\" wrote Paul Gallant, policy analyst for TD Cowen, in a report Wednesday. Matt Perault of New Street Research notes that TikTok could challenge any ban on First Amendment grounds, which would result in a lengthy court battle at the very least. Mr. Chew may have gotten buried by political grandstanding on Thursday. But for investors, it is still too early to be dancing on TikTok\\'s grave.',\n",
       "  'WASHINGTON—Top progressive Democrats said they have disagreements with President Biden but remain staunch supporters headed into the 2024 election, after moves by the administration on issues such as crime, immigration and energy policy angered the party\\'s left wing. Mr. Biden sided with Republicans on overturning Washington, D.C.\\'s crime code , prompting howls from progressives for stepping on home rule, and the White House has drawn scrutiny for considering a return to a policy of detaining migrant families who cross illegally into the U.S. The administration also approved the Willow oil-drilling project over the objections of environmentalists. Progressive lawmakers and activists criticized the moves, but the blowback has been limited. No major protests have emerged outside the White House, like those seen during former President Barack Obama\\'s administration , and there has been no talk of a serious primary challenger from the progressive flank. Many see Mr. Biden as critical to winning the coming presidential race and helping take back full control of Congress, even if they aren\\'t always on the same page. \"I\\'m opposed to the Willow project, which will mean fossil-fuel drilling on federal land, and I do think the president will need to have a bold climate policy to mobilize young voters in 2024,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), a progressive who is considering running for Senate next year. Still, on the presidential race, Mr. Khanna said: \"I\\'ll be backing him enthusiastically.\" Progressives have been the loudest voices within the party on matters including policing, LGBT issues, economic opportunity and protecting the environment. Mr. Biden ran in 2020 as a seasoned centrist but has worked with progressives on many of their priorities—including passing a bill designed to slow climate change and taking executive action to trim student loans. \"It\\'s no secret that the president wasn\\'t my first choice in 2020,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.) who leads the House progressives. But after working together she plans to support him in 2024. She said progressives will continue to \"push where we need to push.\" A recent NBC/PBS NewsHour poll said that 50% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents think Democrats have a better chance of winning the White House if Mr. Biden is the nominee, compared with 45% who think the party would do better with someone else. Mr. Biden is expected to formally announce he is running later this year. The White House said it is in regular touch with progressive leaders on Capitol Hill. With House Democrats now in the minority, progressives are pressuring Mr. Biden to take more executive actions, bypassing Congress. Staff for the Congressional Progressive Caucus met with the White House\\'s Office of Legislative Affairs on Tuesday to talk about their wish list , which includes a range of demands, from expanding worker overtime protections to declaring a national climate emergency. Last year, progressives pressed Mr. Biden to cancel student loan debt. Ultimately Mr. Biden issued an executive order to cancel up to $20,000 in debt , short of what some progressives wanted. The Supreme Court is expected to decide the fate of the program by late June. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) both ran against Mr. Biden in the 2020 Democratic primary, proposing student-loan forgiveness and expanded government health coverage. They now back Mr. Biden if he seeks another term. \"I think what the progressive movement in the country has done is to show the political establishment that millions of people are tired of status quo politics,\" said Mr. Sanders. \"Is he doing everything that I would like? No, but I think he has heard that message,\" he said. \"I thought they were wrong,\" Ms. Warren said of the president\\'s recent moves on immigration, drilling and crime, while praising his actions on climate and corporate taxes. \"Joe Biden and I don\\'t agree on everything, but I\\'m really glad he\\'s president of the U.S.,\" she said on NBC News. The White House cited Mr. Biden\\'s recently released budget , which proposes child care, paid leave and free community college, as showing shared goals. But the White House is also trying to take a tough line on issues such as crime and illegal immigration that Republicans make clear will be a focus in 2024. The Biden administration has crossed progressives on a string of issues in recent months. The administration approved the Willow oil-drilling project in the Alaskan Arctic, arguing it had limited legal options and stressed that the president has moved to block future oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Ocean\\'s federal waters. On immigration, the administration is considering a return to a policy of detaining migrant families as it looks to more restrictive policies to control the southern border. The White House said no decision has been made yet on family detention. On the D.C. crime bill, many Democrats were upset because they felt blindsided. The White House initially said it opposed the bill but then pivoted and said Mr. Biden would sign it. The White House said Mr. Biden never issued an explicit veto threat and emphasized his record of supporting funding for public safety. \"Our view is this is like a family,\" said White House Legislative Affairs Director Louisa Terrell of the D.C. bill. \"We have Democrats on the House side and Democrats on the Senate side, and we are a family, and we have heard this, and we\\'ve talked it through, and we\\'re now two weeks later, and we\\'re moving on,\" she said.',\n",
       "  'TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has kept out of the limelight until recently. PHOTO: Alyssa Schukar for The Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON—TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Zi Chew has navigated both Western and Chinese business over the course of his fast rise to the corner office. That cultural straddle has helped land him the top job at one of the world\\'s biggest tech companies. His background also provided a potential connection with a skeptical American Congress . Many members have threatened to ban TikTok, saying its Chinese ownership poses a national-security threat . But on Thursday, the 40-year-old Singaporean army reservist and former Goldman Sachs banker faced a hostile House panel as he tried to reassure Americans their data is safe and Beijing won\\'t be able to influence what viewers see on TikTok. Hours before the testimony, Beijing said it would oppose a forced sale of the app from its Chinese owners, something the Biden administration has demanded . That amped up the hearing\\'s geopolitical dimensions, thrusting Mr. Chew into the middle of souring U.S.-China relations. House lawmakers then pummeled TikTok\\'s chief executive over the popular app\\'s ties to China. The congressional hearing was peppered with withering attacks on TikTok from both Democrats and Republicans, running more than five hours and underscoring growing concern about Beijing\\'s potential influence over the app. Born and raised in Singapore, then educated in London and at Harvard Business School, Mr. Chew spent some of his early career cutting deals for a venture-capital firm in Asia. He then quickly moved to the C-suite as the chief financial officer of a Chinese smartphone giant at age 32. He runs TikTok from offices in Singapore, but travels often, including frequently to the U.S. He met his wife, a Taiwanese-American who grew up in Bethesda, Md., at Harvard. Relatively unknown for the boss of one of the world\\'s most popular apps, Mr. Chew was sharply questioned by some of the company\\'s more skeptical critics on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Aides to the Republicans who control the committee say there is essentially nothing Mr. Chew can say that would change their minds as they threaten a nationwide ban. In an interview from the company\\'s WeWork offices in Washington, he said he views Thursday\\'s hearing as a chance to explain what TikTok is trying to do, and to get feedback from Congress members—not a last-gasp effort to save TikTok\\'s American business. \"I look at it as an opportunity to do that, not a do-or-die\" moment, he said. The corporate stakes for Mr. Chew are as high as they get for a CEO facing such an appearance in Washington. Some Congress members from both major parties are pushing for a nationwide ban of the video app, citing national-security threats. The Biden administration is demanding TikTok divest itself from its Chinese parent ByteDance Ltd. or face such a ban. Critics say China could force TikTok to hand over American user data or influence what American viewers see on the app. TikTok has said it has never received such a request and would refuse to comply with one. Mr. Chew took over the top job after Kevin Mayer, a high-profile Walt Disney Co. alum, left his post after three months, while the Trump administration pursued an earlier effort to force a sale of TikTok to U.S. investors. He is a native English speaker who, like most Singaporeans, is of Chinese ancestry. His father worked in construction and his mother in bookkeeping. He said he was uprooted from a modest upbringing at age 12, when high marks on a national exam sent him to an elite high school. Mr. Chew was put on an officer track during his mandatory 2½ years of military service. That added 10 years to his eligibility for reserve duty, which ends when he is 50. The hardest physical experience of his life, he said, was the military\\'s five-day survival course in Brunei\\'s jungles. He built a hut, cooked wild yams and trekked 55 miles. At one point during such courses, trainees are given a live quail that they can kill with their hands before skinning and cooking it. In the interview, Mr. Chew didn\\'t want to discuss what he did with his bird. After the military, Mr. Chew attended University College London and remained in the British capital to work as a banker for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Following an internship at Meta Platforms Inc.\\'s Facebook and business school, Mr. Chew worked for venture-capital firm DST Global. His high-school-level Mandarin qualified him to be its China-focused partner. In 2012, he visited the Chinese equivalent of a Silicon Valley garage: an apartment in Beijing\\'s university district. Thirty people, including a chef, crammed in to develop an app that suggested news articles to people based on factors such as how much time they spent on previous stories. The company was ByteDance Ltd ., which would later go on to create TikTok. Its founder, a young Zhang Yiming, won over Mr. Chew. He and his partners invested in the company. \"The idea is so simple but so powerful: that you should be looking at content not based on who you know, but really based on your own behavior,\" Mr. Chew said. Another investment Mr. Chew led was in Xiaomi Corp., a Chinese smartphone giant with global ambitions. Xiaomi brought him over first as chief financial officer, and then had him run its business outside China. One thing that stood out among colleagues was his grasp of both Chinese and Western business cultures. \"He\\'s perfectly bicultural,\" said Hugo Barra, a former Xiaomi executive who worked with Mr. Chew. \"That\\'s a critical asset for an executive of a Chinese company trying to become a global company.\" Mr. Chew led Xiaomi to an initial public offering in 2018, but its shares struggled immediately afterward, during a difficult financial period for Chinese tech companies. In 2021, Mr. Zhang, who had kept in touch with Mr. Chew, asked the Singaporean to become the finance chief of ByteDance, which in addition to TikTok operates other popular Chinese apps. Mr. Chew did that for two months until he and the founder decided he would be better off running TikTok. TikTok has rolled out billions of dollars of spending aimed at siloing off the app from its Chinese owners, and it said it would hire Oracle Corp. to independently monitor against any interference by Beijing. The measures amount to what the company says is an unprecedented effort to assure Americans their data is safe—one that keeps TikTok unprofitable for now. TikTok faces the ban from Washington while it continues to be hugely popular across the country. Mr. Chew, in his own TikTok video on Tuesday, appealed directly to American users, calling attention to the possible ban. In the video he said the app had 150 million users in the U.S., almost half the country\\'s population. Mr. Chew said he accepted the commerce committee\\'s invitation because he wanted to address misconceptions about TikTok, both to Congress and the American public. \"There are some things [being said] that are outright just wrong about our company, and we do need to clarify it,\" he said in the interview.',\n",
       "  'General Mills, maker of Cheerios and other food brands, said consumers have taken higher prices in stride this year. PHOTO: Kristen Norman for The Wall Street Journal General Mills Inc. executives said inflation isn\\'t letting up, but customers are sticking with its products despite higher prices in grocery stores. The Minneapolis-based maker of Cheerios and Betty Crocker cake mix said Thursday that it expects cost increases to moderate but remain above normal in the company\\'s fiscal 2024, which begins later this year. General Mills expects expenses tied to labor, energy and the company\\'s suppliers to keep cost inflation in the mid-single digits, compared with about 14% to 15% this fiscal year. \"The environment remains challenging and dynamic,\" said Jeff Harmening, General Mills\\' chief executive. General Mills executives said that while prices for some key raw commodities have declined from their recent peaks, costs incurred by suppliers that turn those commodities into products for the company are expected to remain elevated. Still, General Mills said consumers have taken higher prices in stride this year more than they have historically. General Mills on Thursday boosted its outlook for sales and profits after revenue rose 13% in its latest quarter, driven largely by higher prices. The amount of food the company sold globally was flat, including declines in its North American retail and international businesses. Mr. Harmening said consumers are still eating at home more than they did before the pandemic, and that General Mills sees that continuing. Consumers have seen their grocery bills surge as food makers have passed on what executives have said are climbing costs for ingredients, transportation and labor. Higher prices have helped boost sales for food manufacturers such as Kellogg Co. and Kraft Heinz Co., but they have often chipped away at volumes. Containing such rising costs is a central part of the Federal Reserve\\'s efforts to bring down inflation that remains stubbornly high. The consumer-price index, a closely watched inflation gauge, rose 6% in February from a year earlier, down from a 6.4% gain the prior month, according to the Labor Department. It was the smallest increase since September 2021. Food inflation has begun to slow , though U.S. grocery prices were still up 10% in February from a year earlier, the Labor Department said. An index for meats, poultry, fish and eggs fell 0.1% in February, the first decrease since December 2021. An index for eggs alone fell 6.7%. Sales at General Mills\\' North America retail division, which includes U.S. groceries, rose 15% in the quarter, which ended Feb. 26. The company said its products have gained market share in cereal, refrigerated dough, fruit snacks, soup and seasoning categories this year, as it has ratcheted up marketing spending. Rising costs hurt operating profit in the company\\'s pet food business, though sales in that unit also increased. \"The consumer seems to be reasonably robust,\" Mr. Harmening said. While private-label products, which are typically cheaper than brand-name equivalents, picked up market share during the last economic recession, Mr. Harmening said, General Mills was able to hang on to its share. General Mills\\' exposure to private-label products remains lower than average, which bodes well for its future, he said. General Mills shares closed 2.9% higher on Thursday. For the full year, General Mills now forecasts organic sales , which exclude acquisitions, divestitures and the impact of currency translation, rising between 10% and 11%, slightly higher than the outlook it gave last month. Per-share earnings are expected to rise 8% to 9% on an adjusted basis, also a slight increase. General Mills posted earnings of $553.1 million, or 92 cents a share, for the most recent quarter, down from $660.3 million, or $1.08 a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings were 97 cents a share, above analysts\\' estimates of 92 cents. Denny Jacob contributed to this article.',\n",
       "  'When Yolett McPhee-McCuin saw the Mississippi women\\'s basketball coaching job was open in 2018, she didn\\'t wait for a call. She reached out to the school\\'s search firm and sold herself. \"I\\'m hot,\" she said. \"And y\\'all could get me for cheap.\" McPhee-McCuin had turned around Jacksonville University\\'s team from several losing seasons to 24-9. Ole Miss had little to lose, having won exactly one Southeastern Conference game the season before. Five years later, McPhee-McCuin and her No. 8-seeded Rebels engineered one of the NCAA women\\'s tournament\\'s biggest upsets, beating perennial power and No. 1 seed Stanford on Sunday. The Rebels face No. 5 Louisville on Friday in the Sweet 16. While women\\'s college basketball has been dominated by dynastic coaches or those who\\'ve played in the Olympics, McPhee-McCuin is \"out of the mud,\" she said. She grew up in the Caribbean nation of the Bahamas, whose entire national population of 408,000 wouldn\\'t quite fill the stands over an eight-game home season of Ole Miss football. McPhee-McCuin had an unremarkable college career—Miami-Dade Community College, followed by Rhode Island—then clambered up a splintery coaching ladder to become the reigning NCAA women\\'s tournament darling. McPhee-McCuin\\'s route included crisscrossing the U.S. to unglamorous assistant jobs: a junior college in the Texas panhandle city of Borger, nicknamed \"Booger Town\"; Arkansas-Pine Bluff; the University of Portland (Ore.); Pittsburgh; and Clemson before landing her first head coaching job, at Jacksonville. \"I always use, like, basketball analogies, and I say: For my life, y\\'all, I never get a wide-open layup,\" McPhee-McCuin said. \"I always have to do a pro-hop or a Euro step to score in life.\" Coach Yo, as she\\'s known, had a knack for connecting with people, though—precious currency in the player recruitment that drives college basketball. She told the Coach JB Show podcast this week: \"I don\\'t know that I\\'m ever going to be googly-eyes over the McDonald\\'s All-American. Give me the Wendy\\'s All-American all day, every day.\" It was a journey to an actual fast-food restaurant that helped land one of her most important recruits. Kayla Gordon, a standout at Meridian (Miss.) High in the early 2010s, recalled that she was a homebody with no interest in leaving the state. But Coach Yo wanted her on the team in Jacksonville, about an eight-hour drive away. So one day, McPhee-McCuin surprised Gordon by walking into the Chick-fil-A where she worked. As the two chatted, Gordon said she marveled at the steps McPhee-McCuin had taken: calling her mom to find out when she was working, making the trip, showing up and showing Gordon how much she valued her. \"I\\'m like, \\'Wow, I feel special,\\'\" Gordon recalled. Gordon played four years at Jacksonville, leading the team in rebounding her senior year. After school she took two more leaps inspired by Coach Yo: The former homebody went to Europe, playing professionally in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Finland. And Gordon went into coaching. She\\'s now an assistant women\\'s basketball coach at Jacksonville. Ross Bjork, the Ole Miss athletic director in 2018, said that Coach Yo was on Mississippi\\'s list of potential women\\'s basketball coaches—a list 25 people long. As he interviewed candidates, said Bjork, now Texas A&M\\'s athletic director, a representative of the search firm hired by the school reminded him, \"Hey, don\\'t forget about Coach Yo.\" That representative, now TurnkeyZRG managing director Chad Chatlos, said McPhee-McCuin was, \"just was like a bulldog: \\'Put me in front of the AD. I won\\'t let you down.\\' Yolett just had this perfect blend of being aggressive but being respectful of the process.\" Bjork and an Ole Miss colleague finally set up a FaceTime call with McPhee-McCuin and, Bjork said, \"She, like, jumped through the screen with her energy and passion.\" Coach Yo was also fearless, something he needed in a coach coming into a tough conference for a rebuilding job. McPhee-McCuin muddled through two rough seasons—9-22, 7-23—before pushing Ole Miss above .500 in 2021, then to the NCAA tournament\\'s first round in 2022. This season, the Rebels narrowly lost against SEC power LSU and defending NCAA champion South Carolina. Then came the second-round NCAA upset of Stanford and a spontaneous celebration by all the people who\\'ve been in Coach Yo\\'s orbit. The Bahamas Basketball Federation, for which McPhee-McCuin has coached the women\\'s national team and assisted in coaching the men\\'s team, congratulated her on its social-media sites. College football talk-show king Paul Finebaum had her on . Fellow Bahamian and WNBA star Jonquel Jones of the New York Liberty tweeted a video of herself dancing and saying, \"We just knocked out a No. 1 seed!\" Jones later explained in an interview: \"The Bahamas is a small country, so it\\'s \\'we.\\' We take our wins wherever we can get them.\" Jones—a four-time WNBA All-Star and the 2021 league MVP—said that McPhee-McCuin\\'s father, a legendary high school coach named Gladstone \"Moon\" McPhee, \"basically taught me everything I know about basketball.\" There were few games or tournaments for girls in the Bahamas, Jones said, so players had to fit into boys\\' schedules or train by themselves. As a teenager Yolett woke her father at 5 a.m. each weekday and they would head to an outdoor court to get a workout in. Then she would go home to clean up in time for her mother, Daisy, who was also the school principal, to unlock the school gates at 7 a.m., according to the Mississippi Clarion-Ledger . The Rebels took down Stanford the old-school way: with defense and free throws. Ole Miss forward Madison Scott recalled that Coach Yo had said the key to beating the Cardinal on their court—the women\\'s tournament awards higher-seeded teams with early-round home games—was improving on the Rebels\\' shooting from the line, a dismal 67.3% this season. \"Before we left, we were in Oxford (Miss.) shooting free throws every day before practice, after practice,\" Scott said. It paid off: Ole Miss made 11 of 14 free throws against Stanford. The Rebels won, 54-49. Jones said she was moved as she watched an on-court interview where Coach Yo called herself a \"little girl from the Bahamas that was given an opportunity\" and dedicated the win to \"people with a dollar and a dream.\" \"Of course, that\\'s going to resonate with so many other people, not just Bahamians, who have big dreams but they don\\'t necessarily know how they can get from point A to point B,\" Jones said. \"So for her to be able to share those stories is, you know, that\\'s what it\\'s all about. That\\'s what sports is all about.\"',\n",
       "  'U.S.-China relations were dealt another blow as lawmakers at a House hearing pressed TikTok\\'s chief executive on the popular app\\'s ties to China, and as Beijing said it would fight any U.S. attempt to force the company\\'s sale by its Chinese owners. The hearing Thursday, peppered with withering attacks on TikTok from both Democrats and Republicans, ran more than five hours and underscored growing concern about Beijing\\'s potential influence over the app. U.S.-China relations are already frayed over trade, Taiwan, technology and geopolitical rivalries. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, seated in front of U.S. TikTok executives and popular stars on the platform, sought to reassure lawmakers that the company would earn their trust. \"Our approach has never been to dismiss or trivialize any of these concerns. We have addressed them with real action,\" he said. Rep. Frank Pallone (D., N.J.), the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, issued a blunt response to Mr. Chew\\'s claims. \"I don\\'t buy it,\" Mr. Pallone said. The committee\\'s chairwoman, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.), called for banning the app , which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. The bipartisan skepticism further clouded the future of a platform that TikTok says is now used by 150 million Americans . Hours before the hearing, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would \"firmly oppose\" the Biden administration\\'s recent demand that TikTok\\'s Chinese owners sell their stakes or face a possible ban. U.S. lawmakers pointed to that statement as evidence that the company was beholden to Beijing. TikTok\\'s travails have put it at the center of strained ties between the world\\'s two great economic powers as they quarrel over issues including trade policy, surveillance and technological development. Washington has stepped up sanctions against Chinese companies, and Beijing has deployed regulatory enforcement and other pressure tactics against American businesses. The resulting trade blacklists have swept up China-based telecommunications companies Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., as well as U.S. defense contractors Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Technologies Corp. \"The TikTok battles are indicative of the end of an era,\" said Lindsay Gorman, senior fellow for emerging technologies at the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, and a former Biden White House adviser. \"This era where U.S.-China business relations can continue absent considerations of geopolitics is over.\" The U.S. concerns over TikTok have partly stemmed from increased involvement in business activities by the Chinese government. Under leader Xi Jinping, China\\'s party-state has adopted laws and regulations to ensure its access to data collected by private firms, and expanded efforts to influence corporate governance and decision-making. China has also blocked U.S. social media and information sites including Alphabet Inc.\\'s Google and the Meta Platforms Inc.\\'s Facebook. A fund backed by China\\'s cybersecurity watchdog holds a 1% stake in the core subsidiary of TikTok\\'s Chinese parent, Bytedance Ltd., a what is called \"golden share\" that gives the regulator a board seat at the subsidiary, voting power and sway over its business decisions. Under questioning from Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R., Texas), Mr. Chew said that under the company\\'s security plan, TikTok\\'s data would be stored in the U.S. and controlled by a U.S. company, alleviating the concern. Mr. Crenshaw responded: \"I want to say this to all the teenagers out there and TikTok influencers who think we\\'re just old and out of touch and…. trying to take away your favorite app. You may not care that your data is being accessed now, but it will be one day when you do care about it.\" Mrs. Rodgers opened the questioning Thursday by asking Mr. Chew to state \"with 100% certainty\" that the Chinese government couldn\\'t use TikTok or ByteDance to surveil Americans or manipulate the content Americans see. Mr. Chew said the company was committed to firewalling U.S. user data from \"all unwanted foreign access\" and would keep content \"free from any manipulation from any government.\" \"If you can\\'t say it 100% certain, I take that as a \\'no,\\'\" Mrs. Rodgers shot back. \"I have zero confidence in your assertion that ByteDance and TikTok are not beholden to the [Chinese Communist Party].\" In his testimony , Mr. Chew said TikTok is spending $1.5 billion to create the firewall of U.S. data, leaving \"American data stored on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel.\" When that process is complete, he said, it should eliminate lawmakers\\' concern that some TikTok user data could be subject to Chinese law—though he said engineers globally could access it as required for business purposes. Asked about a possible sale, Mr. Chew said he didn\\'t think a change in ownership would improve safety and security, pointing to the privacy problems of U.S. tech platforms. Mr. Chew also said the platform would work to ensure a safe environment for young people, another concern of committee members. Rep. Bob Latta (R., Ohio) said TikTok had been insulated from legal claims arising from the death of a 10-year-old girl who had participated in a breath-holding challenge that was popular on TikTok. Mr. Latta questioned why TikTok should be protected by federal law shielding websites when it amplifies \"dangerous and life-threatening content to children.\" Mr. Chew said that the platform has taken a number of proactive steps to better protect children—including measures that go beyond those employed by other platforms. Accounts registered to teens under 16 are set to private by default, and they also can\\'t send direct messages. Their content is ineligible for recommendation in the app\\'s popular \"For You\" tab. He said dealing with harmful content was an industrywide challenge. Some lawmakers asked Mr. Chew if he agreed that China\\'s government has persecuted the Uyghur ethnic group, which U.S. officials have characterized as a genocide. Mr. Chew answered by saying content about that issue was available on TikTok. After the testimony ended, TikTok spokeswoman Brooke Oberwetter said that political grandstanding had dominated the hearing, ignoring the solutions TikTok was working on to protect user data and keep content harmful to young people off the site. The hearing shed little light on how Congress might address the numerous problems with TikTok that lawmakers highlighted. Several bills are under consideration in Congress that would ban TikTok outright, typically by prohibiting U.S. companies from doing business with it. Some would also allow the government to ban or restrict other apps with ties to hostile foreign governments. Several lawmakers also urged renewed consideration of comprehensive privacy legislation. An actual ban on TikTok faces practical and legal hurdles, and two federal judges struck down former President Donald Trump\\'s earlier attempts to do so. Any crackdown carries political risks, particularly for Democrats who tend to get more support from the younger people who are TikTok\\'s dominant audience. Democrats appeared less inclined than Republicans to support an outright ban on the app, at least for now. Three Democrats appeared Wednesday with a group of TikTok stars to protest calls to ban the app. But a number of lawmakers from both parties expressed interest in a sale of TikTok\\'s Chinese ownership. Rep. Lori Trahan (D., Mass.) said near the end of Thursday\\'s hearing that Mr. Chew had fallen short of gaining lawmakers\\' trust. \"To me, it hasn\\'t happened so far,\" she said. Rep. Randy Weber (R., Tex.) took a similar-sounding tone. \"If this committee has its way,\" he said, \"TikTok\\'s time is up.\" \\u200bLingling Wei, Stu Woo, Grace Zhu and Raffaele Huang contributed to this article.',\n",
       "  'Virginia-based power company AES Corp. says it is ready to push the button on a solar-panel order of more than $1 billion if a manufacturer will commit to building a factory in the U.S. If that factory gets built, AES can buy its panels and apply for federal subsidies recently made available to clean-energy developers that use equipment made in the U.S. There is one problem: The government hasn\\'t decided what \"made in the U.S.\" means, and how strictly to define it. \"You can\\'t sign on the dotted line until this is clarified,\" said Andrés Gluski, AES\\'s chief executive. The company and two other developers have said they would collectively buy as much as $6 billion in panels from a manufacturer that sets up in the U.S. Just what qualifies as made in America is one of the biggest questions still hanging over the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed in August that offers hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits and other incentives for clean-energy projects . The issue is more complicated than it might seem, given that almost all clean-energy projects require at least some parts that are manufactured overseas. The law is supposed to spur not only the deployment of clean energy but also the creation of domestic jobs and industries to underpin that rollout. So lawmakers sprinkled support for U.S.-made products throughout the legislation—from rebates for buying electric vehicles that contain significant domestic content to bonus tax credits for solar or wind developers that use enough U.S.-manufactured equipment. \"If we\\'re going to use federal tax dollars, we\\'re going to direct that investment into the United States and create American jobs,\" said John Podesta, senior adviser to President Biden for clean-energy innovation and implementation, at a Houston energy conference in early March. \"We\\'ve for too long let our supply chains drift overseas, particularly to China.\" As much as half of potentially $500 billion-plus in investment generated by the Inflation Reduction Act\\'s incentives include some sort of domestic-content requirements or bonus, according to an analysis by research institute Rhodium Group. The money at stake has made defining what it would take to meet those requirements one of the most hotly contested aspects of the law, spurring complaints from governments as well as tussles among companies ranging from U.S. steelmaker Nucor Corp. to power company NextEra Energy Inc.—all of which are angling for as much of the green subsidies as possible. The details are being completed by the Treasury Department and are expected to come out over the next few months. The rules on one important incentive— a $7,500 tax rebate for electric-vehicle purchases , if the cars and their batteries meet domestic content and sourcing requirements—are expected by the end of this month. Meanwhile, many would-be investors are hanging back. In solar, wind and storage projects alone, about $20 billion in investment could be on hold while the government sorts out a variety of tax-credit details, with much of the attention on domestic-content rules, say clean-energy analysts. A big challenge is that much of the manufacturing the law is trying to spur barely exists in the U.S. today, from the silicon ingots and special glass needed for solar panels to the large steel plates for offshore wind arrays. The bulk of those products and components are instead imported from overseas, particularly China , which offers cheaper prices and controls the supply chain for goods such as solar panels and batteries. Defining \"made in America\" in a way that excludes most of those imports could mean nobody would meet domestic-content requirements or get the incentives tied to them, some green-energy developers say. Take solar projects, which under the legislation could in some cases receive 10% more in bonus tax credits if enough of the equipment by value is made domestically. That incentive has sparked a furious debate over solar panels, which alone can comprise 40% of the total equipment cost of a solar plant and are crucial to getting the bonus. Companies such as NextEra, the U.S.\\'s biggest developer of solar projects, are urging that panels assembled in the U.S. be considered American-made, even if the ingredients come from overseas. Such a definition would let more developers get bonus credits and encourage the construction of more solar farms, they reason. Developers need those bonus credits to offset higher panel costs that would come with moving more of the solar supply chain to the U.S., says AES clean-energy head Leonardo Moreno. Companies such as South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group\\'s Qcells unit, which is planning a U.S. factory for panel components such as solar cells, disagree. A solar panel shouldn\\'t be defined as U.S.-made if its most important pieces, especially the cells that convert sunlight to electricity, are made overseas, Hanwha said, in public comments submitted to the Treasury Department. Those components tend to be particularly costly and challenging to make, so the U.S. won\\'t be able to build a domestic solar supply chain unless renewable-power developers are nudged to buy panels that use them, said Michael Carr, a partner at government-affairs consulting firm Boundary Stone Partners, which is lobbying for some manufacturers. Another contentious point is how to treat equipment made of iron and steel, such as the tower that holds up the engine and blades of a wind turbine. The legislation says the iron and steel should be made in America for a renewable-energy project to qualify for domestic-content bonuses, but is vague on exactly what that means. BCI Steel makes tubes for solar-panel trackers in Leetsdale, Pa. U.S. steelmakers say equipment that uses imported steel shouldn\\'t count as being made in America. PHOTO: Ross Mantle for The Wall Street Journal Many renewable-energy developers are pushing for a domestic-content definition that would let them import many of those steel components. Such a definition would \"effectively nullify any benefit at all in the IRA,\" said Robert DeFrancesco, a lawyer at Wiley Rein LLP who is counsel for the Wind Tower Trade Coalition, a handful of big U.S. manufacturers. U.S. steelmakers have also weighed in, especially because the clean-energy industry\\'s demand for steel is expected to triple by 2030, according to some estimates. Developers \"shouldn\\'t get the credit that was intended to benefit American workers if they are bringing [steel] from overseas,\" said Al Behr, Nucor\\'s executive vice president for plate and structural steel.',\n",
       "  'Hedge funds that bet on big-picture market moves have been hit with steep losses as a spate of recent bank failures upends bets that interest rates would remain elevated. The souring of the wager led some, including Maniyar Capital Advisors and Haidar Capital Management, to lose more than 20% this month. Many of the funds, which had notched big gains as rates marched steadily upward in 2022, are now flat to down for the year following a steep recent drop in Treasury yields. So-called trend-followers, which try to take advantage of momentum in markets, also were hurt. Some macro funds sustained lesser losses. Bridgewater Associates\\'s flagship Pure Alpha fund had lost a little more than 3% in March through Friday in its higher-volatility share class, while Switzerland-based EDL Capital, started by former Moore Capital Management money manager Edouard de Langlade, lost 5%, said people familiar with the firms. Overall, macro hedge funds lost an average 3.5% in the period, according to data from research firm HFR. Macro investors since late 2021 had widely been betting that stubbornly high inflation and a tight job market would cause the Federal Reserve to raise rates faster and for longer than previously expected. Instead, recent banking turmoil put a dent in rate expectations, with the yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note notching its largest weekly decline since 1987 last week. (Yields fall as bond prices rise.) Bonds also surged overseas. Traders say losses funds were taking on their bets against Treasurys spread to Japanese government bonds as managers unwound similar bets in efforts to curb losses. Many of the funds use leverage, or borrowed money, to amplify their bets, which can boost gains if the wagers pay off but prove costly if they sour. \"The magnitude of the losses really boils down to the fact that this was a levered trade that abruptly unwound,\" said Greg Dowling, chief investment officer of investment-consulting firm Fund Evaluation Group. In the span of some 48 hours in early March, Silicon Valley Bank\\'s collapse changed investors\\' expectations about the path of interest rates in the U.S., Mr. Dowling said. Where investors previously expected that the Federal Reserve would continue to raise rates, they suddenly were confronted with the possibility that the central bank would ease up, fearing a banking crisis could tip the U.S. economy into recession . Such regime shifts are usually accompanied by months of changing data and messaging from the Federal Reserve. The Fed on Wednesday approved a quarter-percentage-point rate increase but signaled it might be done hiking sooner than previously expected, causing Treasury yields to slip further. London-based Maniyar, a macro hedge fund partly owned by Paul Tudor Jones, lost 22% for the month through Friday, according to people familiar with the firm. Haidar\\'s Jupiter fund, which gained 193% in 2022, lost 32% for the period, said a person familiar with the firm. Bloomberg News earlier reported Haidar\\'s loss. Among trend followers, which also profited by betting on higher rates last year, the Tactical Trend fund of the $18 billion Graham Capital Management lost about 10% for the month through Friday, said people familiar with the firm. Stockholm-based Lynx Asset Management\\'s diversified trend-following strategy, the Lynx Program, also lost roughly 10% for the period. Rob Christian, investment chief at K2 Advisors, a Franklin Templeton unit that invests more than $10 billion of client money in hedge funds, said some giveback of outsize gains was to be expected for trend followers, officially known as commodity trading advisers, or CTAs. \"I always tell people you have to have an iron stomach to invest in CTAs,\" he said. A rare fund that profited is $1 billion Key Square Capital Management, based in Greenwich, Conn. In a March 13 investor letter, founder Scott Bessent, a former investment chief for George Soros, wrote that Key Square the prior week had increased its funds\\' exposures to gold and safe-haven currencies, shorted bank stocks and pulled back on energy exposure. Mr. Bessent since late last year had warned his clients that banks could face losses in their fixed-income and structured-products portfolios. SVB\\'s failed attempt to sell shares before it collapsed the week of March 6 was a signal to Mr. Bessent that Fed rate increases were causing stress in the financial sector, he wrote. It was one of several \"signposts\" that prompted him to further position Key Square\\'s portfolio for deepening turmoil. A person familiar with the firm said Key Square\\'s main hedge fund was up 2.5% for the month through Friday. Another fund employing more leverage had gained 5%.',\n",
       "  'CAIRO—After years of underinvestment in North Africa\\'s energy infrastructure, global oil-and-gas giants from Halliburton Co. and Chevron Corp. to Eni SpA are ramping up their presence in the region as demand from Europe grows . Executives in the industry are betting it is worth drilling again in some of the hardest places to do business in the world as Europe increasingly turns to other sources for its energy needs after shunning its main supplier, Russia, over the invasion of Ukraine . In recent months, a string of European officials have visited the region to help advance talks over potential supply deals. Halliburton and Honeywell International Inc. are hammering out $1.4 billion worth of deals to develop an oil field and refinery with National Oil Corporation in Libya, which has the largest known oil reserves in Africa, according to the chairman of state-owned firm, Farhat Bengdara. Italy\\'s Eni is planning investments aimed at replacing nearly half of the gas it was importing from Russia with gas from Algeria. Chevron is also looking to seal an energy exploration deal in Algeria, The Wall Street Journal reported last month . In January, the U.S. oil major announced a sizable natural-gas discovery in Egypt. \"North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,\" said Geoff Porter, president of U.S.-based North Africa Risk Consulting Inc. But with Europe needing to replace Russian energy , \"this is their moment,\" he said. Western oil executives say they see a more stable political climate in North Africa, especially in countries such as Libya where fighting between local militias has been subdued in the past two years following nearly a decade of civil war. Many American firms had pulled back from the region, viewing it as politically too risky, to focus on shale production at home. The region\\'s proximity to Europe and massive reserves, with Algeria holding the third-largest recoverable shale resources in the world, also make doing business there worth the risk, they say. At the same time, state-owned firms in the North African region have been eager to strike deals, as they see an opportunity to fill a gap left by Russia and take advantage of higher global commodity prices. Some countries, such as Egypt, are eager to bring in additional revenue from selling energy, as their economies struggle with higher import costs including for food . The Ukraine war has disrupted shipments and pushed up global commodity prices. \"I think we can be a good replacement for Russian gas to Europe,\" NOC\\'s Mr. Bengdara said. The Libyan state-owned company is expected to soon sign a $1 billion agreement with Halliburton that will allow the U.S. firm to rebuild the al-Dhara oil field, according to Mr. Bengdara. The oil field in central Libya was destroyed by Islamic State militants in 2015 and is now run by ConocoPhillips and TotalEnergies SE, Mr. Bengdara said. It would be one of the biggest deals for the U.S. oil-services giant clinched in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years. Halliburton and Total didn\\'t respond to requests for comment. ConocoPhillips declined to comment. Libya\\'s NOC and Honeywell are set to unveil a contract related to the construction of a refinery in southern Libya, Mr. Bengdara and a spokesman for the American firm said. The initial deal, expected to be announced this weekend, is for the design of the plant, the spokesman said, which would be followed by a $400 million pact to build the entire plant. Libya relies heavily on its oil resources for income, although it has struggled for years to turn its own crude into motor fuel, making it largely dependent on costly gasoline imports. As of last year, the North African nation was divided politically again, with a United Nations-appointed prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, remaining in control of the capital Tripoli and a rival prime minister taking charge of the country\\'s east. The country is again pushing to hold presidential and legislative elections this year, after plans fell through in 2021. Still, there have been no serious clashes since last summer and its eastern government in recent months has unlocked some of the budget needed by the state oil company to clinch deals with international companies. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a senate committee on Wednesday that the U.S. was actively working to reopen an embassy in Libya, in part so it could better support the prospect of Libyan elections. The U.S. shut its embassy in Tripoli in 2014 following violent clashes between militias. The U.S. also pressured a top Libyan commander in mid-January to expel Russia\\'s paramiliatry Wagner Group , the Journal reported last month, amid fears the unit may tap into the country\\'s oil riches. Khalifa Haftar, commander of a faction that controls eastern Libya , is aligned with the government in Tripoli . \"There is recognition in the U.S. that Libya is a workable environment,\" said Mr. Porter, who advises U.S. oil companies in the region. He added that firms now see it as \"an environment in which you can operate reasonably safely, where you can more predictably invest in ways that you could not have a few years ago.\" NOC exports most of its gas to Europe through a pipeline from Libya to Italy. Over the next three to five years, it aims to increase oil production to 2 million barrels a day, from around 1.2 million currently, and to produce 4 billion standard cubic feet of gas a day, up from roughly 2.6 billion. In January, NOC and Eni, which produces the majority of the country\\'s gas, signed an $8 billion deal for the Italian energy giant to develop two gas fields to pump 850 million cubic feet a day for 25 years. Under the agreement, production of gas will start in 2025, ramping up to full capacity of 850 million cubic feet a day by 2026. In Algeria, Eni is aiming to export an additional 3 billion cubic meters of gas annually, starting this year, to help make up for gas that used to flow from Russia. Algeria will become the firm\\'s top region for investment in the next four years. \"Algeria is a reliable partner of absolute strategic importance,\" said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during a visit to Algiers in January. From Egypt, Eni aims to export three billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Italy starting this year, after regas capacity was built up on the receiving end. That compares with roughly 1 billion cubic meters being exported last year. Egypt\\'s ability to export gas is limited given the growing electricity demand of its more than 100 million population. It doesn\\'t have any pipelines to Europe. Still, the country has ambitions to become a hub for energy distribution in the Mediterranean, importing more gas from Israel and exporting liquefied gas on ships to Italy.

       "  'GARDEN CITY, Kan. -- Southwest Kansas officials have long pushed a moonshot aqueduct project to send Missouri River water across the state to their region, where a $12.5 billion agricultural economy relies on a dwindling underground aquifer. While the effort has been dismissed as legally impossible and expensive, the persistence of the idea demonstrates how drought and a steadily shrinking water supply have created broad consensus that water policies need to be overhauled. In Kansas, where federal data shows that nearly every county was experiencing some level of drought at the end of 2022, water is among the most urgent issues facing the state legislature this year. \"Water has a certain value,\" said Clay Scott, a Ulysses, Kan., farmer and one of the aqueduct\\'s proponents. \"Every year it just continues to climb.\" Projects that move water have been used to fuel development or to irrigate crops in Western states such as Arizona and California. The Kansas aqueduct would be farther east -- reflecting spreading concern about the scarcity of water amid a changing climate and growing population centers. Similar projects are being discussed elsewhere. A groundwater-conservation district in Texas is interested in studying water-transportation projects, including a version of the Kansas aqueduct route extended to Texas, said district manager Steve Walthour. Some arid states have looked east to boost limited water supplies. The Arizona state legislature in 2021 asked Congress to study a plan to transport Mississippi River floodwaters to the Colorado River, upon which seven states including Arizona rely. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers first assessed the feasibility for a Kansas aqueduct in 1982, as part of a federal study looking at ways to supplement the Ogallala Aquifer, the region\\'s critical source of groundwater. A 2015 update of the study estimated it would cost between $5 billion and $20 billion to build the concrete-lined canal system and up to $522 million in annual energy costs to pump the water uphill to its terminal reservoir in western Kansas. Proponents of the Kansas aqueduct say it is needed to sustain the economy of the state\\'s southwest and could sell water to other Western areas that have already taken extreme measures to conserve water or find new water sources. Without a means to augment the region\\'s underground reserves, \"we will continue to dry up the infrastructure for feed yards and dairies and grain elevators and cotton gins,\" said Mr. Scott, who is a member ofthe board for the Southwest Kansas Groundwater Management District. Opponents say the idea is too expensive, and would need to fend off a likely onslaught of lawsuits from states along the Missouri River or landowners whose property would be used to build a canal system. \"The legal, economic, physical and regulatory hurdles this thing faces are virtually infinite,\" said Burke Griggs, a law professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., who is an expert in water law and who previously represented Kansas in federal and interstate water issues. \"There\\'s no way this will ever be built.\" Even those who have taken no position on an aqueduct say much of the aquifer could run dry before the project is complete. \"By the time you got done with studying, planning, litigating, constructing,\" said Connie Owen, who heads the Kansas Water Office, an agency that writes the state\\'s water plan, \"it is too late.\" The Ogallala Aquifer lies under parts of eight central U.S. states, running from South Dakota to Texas. It adds $3.8 billion to the value of the land in western Kansas, one 2022 study found. Blake Brownie Wilson, with the Kansas Geological Survey, says 80% to 90% of the aquifer\\'s water in Kansas goes to irrigation. In some parts of southwest Kansas, the aquifer has dropped more than 100 feet since it began being mined. About 30% of it had been pumped as of 2013. An additional 39% was expected to be gone by 2063 given current rates of use. In December, aboard in the Kansas Water Office recommended that the state stop its policy of slowly draining the aquifer. \"Planned depletion was the operative approach,\" Ms. Owen said. \"It still is.\" Recent drought has increased pressure on the aquifer\\'s use. Groundwater levels fell nearly 3 feet in southwest Kansas, which is experiencing the most intense and widespread drought nationwide. Less than an inch of rainfall typically seeps into the aquifer to recharge it each year. The groundwater district that manages water use in southwest Kansas thinks conserving water is appropriate but not enough. Officials in the district have been the primary proponents of the aqueduct plan in Kansas. The project remains a long shot. Kansas lawmakers this year are focused on bills aimed at promoting conservation and dedicating tax revenue to water projects. Proponents say it is the right time to look into an aqueduct because of how long it would take to be built. \"We can\\'t afford to wait any longer,\" said Mr. Scott.',\n",
       "  'WASHINGTON -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 Republican presidential candidate, sought to qualify his controversial remark that Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine was a \"territorial dispute.\" \"Well, I think it\\'s been mischaracterized,\" he told broadcaster Piers Morgan for an interview to be shown Thursday on the streaming service Fox Nation. Mr. Morgan included the comments in a column Wednesday for The New York Post. \"Obviously, Russia invaded. That was wrong,\" Mr. DeSantis said, according to the column. \"They invaded Crimea and took that in 2014. That was wrong.\" He added, \"What I\\'m referring to is where the fighting is going on now which is that eastern border region Donbas, and then Crimea, and you have a situation where Russia has had that. I don\\'t think legitimately but they had . . . . so it wasn\\'t that I thought Russia had a right to that.\" Mr. DeSantis said last week that the U.S. shouldn\\'t necessarily help defend Ukraine against Russia\\'s invasion and should instead focus resources on issues closer to home. It aligned him with the position of former President Donald Trump and some conservatives who have increasingly questioned thetens of billions the U.S. has provided in security assistance to Ukraine. \"While the U.S. has many vital national interests -- securing our borders, addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy security and independence, and checking the economic, cultural, and military power of the Chinese Communist Party -- becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them,\" Mr. DeSantis had said in a statement broadcast on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" on Fox News.',\n",
       "  'Kassie Meiler endured six hours in an online waiting room to score tickets to one of Taylor Swift\\'s coming concerts. Now, she is gearing up -- literally -- for the stamina test of the pop star\\'s 44-song, three-hour show. Instead of heels, the 27-year-old plans to wear platform Keds, the sneaker brand Ms. Swift once endorsed. Rather than a sparkly fringe jacket similar to what Ms. Swift sports onstage, Ms. Meiler is seeking a cooler option for the April show in Tampa, Fla., that she will attend, perhaps in vest form. She will swap her usual cocktail or white wine for an electrolyte drink, she said. Mentally, Ms. Meiler is pulling confidence from the 24-hour dance marathons she completed in college: \"If I can do that, I can do a Taylor Swift tour.\" Ms. Swift stunned fans opening night on her first tour in five years by performing a 190-minute set that followed two opening acts. Word spread quickly online of the stadium show\\'s length, prompting nervous strategy brainstorms among fans now rethinking everything from their elaborate outfits to hydration methods. The Eras Tour, which is scheduled to run 52 stadium dates, is forecast to become the highest-grossing tour of all time, according to concert-data tracker Pollstar. The show is a combination of Ms. Swift\\'s pandemic pursuits and her efforts to take ownership of her life\\'s work by rerecording her early music. After her festival-style shows for her 2019 \"Lover\" album were canceled because of Covid-19, she released two surprise albums penned in pandemic isolation. The Eras Tour set list spans her entire catalog, including songs from \"Folklore,\" which won the Grammy for Album of the Year and \"Evermore,\" which earned a Grammy nomination -- as well as hits that she rerecorded from \"Fearless\" and \"Red.\" Late last year, she released \"Midnights,\" which shattered sales records. Packing so much material into one show amounts to an endurance test for Ms. Swift, too. Her 44-song set dwarfs that of other rock stars known for long shows, according to data from Setlist.fm. Prince\\'s 2004 shows and Beyonce\\'s 2018 Coachella sets each averaged 32 songs. Bruce Springsteen averaged 29 songs in 1985 and 27 in 2012. Bob Dylan\\'s 1978 world tour averaged 28 songs, according to Setlist.fm. Stadium shows are a badge of honor for music\\'s biggest stars. Only an elite few can fill them, and on this tour Ms. Swift has sold out multiple nights in each city she visits. Her Homeric effort, which includes the 10-minute version of fan-favorite song \"All Too Well,\" is baffling fans and industry insiders. \"Sure, Springsteen and Prince played these legendary long shows, but they were not singing the entire time. They had bands, and a whole lot of instrumental work that extended out the show,\" said Nathan Hubbard, former Ticketmaster chief executive and co-host of the Ringer\\'s \"Every Single Album: Taylor Swift\" podcast series. \"Taylor is singing as the center lead for the entirety of the show, and she\\'s doing it in heels,\" he said. A representative for Ms. Swift didn\\'t respond to a request for comment. In addition to singing and dancing, Ms. Swift flies, runs, climbs and, yes, even dives around the stadium -- in a series of custom Christian Louboutins. \"Three-hour shows. @taylorswift is definitely a distance swimmer,\" Olympic gold-medalist swimmer Katie Ledecky tweeted Tuesday. Mr. Hubbard estimated that if Ms. Swift\\'s movements were tracked as soccer players were during the World Cup, she travels a mile during the show, maybe two. Former NFL defensive end J.J. Watt lauded Ms. Swift\\'s rigor in a 2 1/2-minute video posted to Twitter after seeing her Saturday show in Glendale, Ariz. \"She did not stop the whole time -- there was no halftime, there was no TV timeouts,\" he said. \"She crushed it, and she didn\\'t even look tired. I was tired, and I was just sitting there.\" Daniela Morgan, 40, is doubling up on Las Vegas shows this weekend. On Friday night, she is attending solo with a $760 standing-room-only floor ticket. For Saturday night, She initially planned to take a friend, but her 10-year-old son, Eli, begged to go instead. Eli has heard reminders from his dad about the responsibility that comes with taking a $350 ticket to see his mom\\'s favorite artist, Ms. Morgan said. \"Is my kid going to be able to hang three hours?\" she said. Claire Ginther, a 26-year-old from Huntington Beach, Calif., has a shoe dilemma. To see Ms. Swift in Las Vegas this weekend, she had planned an outfit based on the pastel, 1960s aesthetic of Ms. Swift\\'s \"Lover\" album. Her new go-go boots arrived this week, but now she is debating switching to sneakers for comfort. With her 5\\'1\" height and $750 floor tickets, she risks not being able to see much, she said. For advice, she is combing through TikTok, where concertgoers are trading survival tips. \"You\\'d think people are talking about running the L.A. Marathon,\" she said. \"They\\'re talking about going to see Taylor Swift.\" Meanwhile, Ms. Ginther wonders about Ms. Swift\\'s stamina lasting until the tour\\'s closing shows in Los Angeles in August, for which Ms. Ginther said she paid $100 for a nosebleed seat. \"Is she just going to be crawling to the finish line when she gets to L.A.?\" For an April show in Texas, Catherine Frisina, 33, plans to hydrate sparingly with Liquid I.V., a powder that is mixed with water and promises an energy boost. \"If Taylor doesn\\'t need a bathroom break neither do I,\" she said. Andrea Alfano, who fueled up with pizza for back-to-back concerts on the tour\\'s opening weekend, said making it through the actual show isn\\'t the hardest part. \"The adrenaline of being there carries you through the show itself,\" the 26-year-old daycare teacher said. It was after the show in Glendale -- facing an hourslong wait for an Uber -- when she realized she was tired and her cowboy-boot-clad feet hurt. \"The hardest part is getting out of the stadium.\" At three hours, Rob Dobyns said his favorite part about Ms. Swift\\'s coming show in Kansas City is that his wife and three teen daughters are going and he isn\\'t. The 45-year-old prefers \\'90s Seattle grunge bands but calls himself a Taylor Swift fan by proxy. \"I couldn\\'t tell you the name of any songs but as they\\'re constantly screamed throughout the house, I could probably sing along to several.\" His wife, whom he calls \"the hype man for our family,\" will make the three-hour trek from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Kansas City, Mo., where the four of them will stay in a hote. Back home, Mr. Dobyns, a retired cop turned software engineer, has plans for a marathon of his own: scary movies, beer and steaks for himself and the dog.',\n",
       "  'TORONTO -- Multinational companies are pumping billions of dollars into Canada\\'s electric-vehicle manufacturing sector, lured by government incentives, access to raw materials and cheap renewable energy. In the latest sign of interest in the country, German auto maker Volkswagen Group last week said it had chosen a site in the province of Ontario to build its first battery-cell plant outside Europe. A company spokesman declined to provide specifics about the investment, but Canada\\'s industry minister said the investment, in the town of St. Thomas, 120 miles northeast of Detroit, could rank as the largest ever made in Canada\\'s auto sector. \"This is a big moment for Canada,\" said Francois-Philippe Champagne, Canada\\'s minister of innovation, science and industry, about the many investments. Volkswagen cited Canada\\'s natural resources as one of the reasons for choosing Ontario. \"Canada offers ideal conditions, including the local supply of raw materials and wide access to clean electricity,\" the company said. Volkswagen\\'s planned factory follows recent electric-vehicle and battery-making project investments by General Motors Co., Stellantis NV, French tire maker Michelin NV, Brazilian miner Vale, its U.K.-based rival Rio Tinto PLC, and German chemicals company BASF SE, among others. Canada is benefiting from a push by the U.S. and its allies to reduce their dependence on China for the critical minerals used in electric-vehicle batteries and military equipment. Companies announced more than $11 billion in investments in electric-vehicle-related projects in Canada last year, according to a tally of company announcements. The U.S., which has an economy that is 12 times as large as Canada\\'s, recorded $38.9 billion of similar investments in 2022, according to the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan-based nonprofit. In one example, Stellantis and South Korea\\'s LG Energy Solution are building a $4.1 billion battery plant in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river from Detroit. The joint venture, named NextStar Energy Inc., broke ground on the factory late last year and could employ 2,500 workers when it becomes operational in 2024, Stellantis said. Canada has had to pay up to win the investments, scrambling to keep up with the U.S., which has unveiled a raft of subsidies and tax breaks meant to draw capital investment in the EV industry. In the case of the NextStar project, Canada\\'s federal government and the province of Ontario gave more than one billion Canadian dollars, equivalent to $732 million, to the joint venture, said people with knowledge of the transaction. The Canadian government has also contributed money to investments by Rio Tinto, Honda Canada Inc., GM and others. The new investments, many of which are still in the early stages, come amid a decadeslong decline in the Canadian auto industry. Canada is among the most expensive countries in the world to build cars and the highest-cost market for car assembly in the North American free-trade zone. To save money, auto makers in recent decades moved thousands of manufacturing jobs and motor-vehicle assembly capacity to Mexico. At its peak in 1999, Canadian auto production surpassed three million vehicles and employed more than 175,000 people, according to the Trillium Network for Advanced Manufacturing, a nonprofit. Last year, the local industry produced 1.2 million vehicles and employed 110,000 people. It is unclear whether the new investments will reverse the declining trend, said Greig Mordue, an associate processor at the University of McMaster\\'s W. Booth School of Engineering Practice and Technology. Making batteries and electric vehicles needs fewer people than assembling internal-combustion-engine cars, he said, and the amount of money invested using taxpayer funds could limit the economic benefit. \"Until we know how much we paid for this, I\\'ll reserve my judgment on how good a deal this is,\" said Mr. Mordue, in reference to the Volkswagen deal. Mr. Champagne declined to disclose the value of subsidies and incentives that the government offered Volkswagen. He said the long-term benefits to the Canadian economy from the new projects justify the government\\'s investments.',\n",
       "  'WASHINGTON -- TikTok launched a battalion of influencers in the nation\\'s capital Wednesday to send a message to Congress: Banning the app would be met with widespread popular opposition. \"TikTok is not a children\\'s dancing app,\" said Aidan Kohn-Murphy, a college freshman with close to 300,000 TikTok followers and founder of the advocacy group Gen-Z for Change. \"It is one of the most powerful tools that young people have to engage each other and to get civically involved.\" Mr. Kohn-Murphy was one of more than 20 TikTok personalities with wide followings who traveled to the capital this week at the company\\'s invitation to lobby lawmakers and others in advance of TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew\\'s appearance before a House committee on Thursday. The influencers\\' blitz is part of TikTok\\'s response to persistent concerns among U.S. officials that the app, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., could be used by the Chinese government to spy on Americans or promote divisive or manipulative content. The Biden administration recently demanded that TikTok\\'s Chinese owners sell their stakes in the company or face a possible U.S. ban of the app, and members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee are expected to question Mr. Chew about the security concerns and other issues. TikTok maintains that it isn\\'t beholden to any government and is a vital platform for 150 million American users -- a theme the influencers worked to underscore in a meeting with journalists near the Capitol on Wednesday. \"It would be difficult to be able to support a candidate that would take away something that is so integral to the direction we\\'re going as a society,\" said Baedri Nichole, a bakery owner from Columbus, Ohio, whose \"hot cocoa bomb\" confection is a hit on TikTok. Kenny Jary, an 81-year-old retiree known on TikTok as Patriotic Kenny, said he uses the app to raise money to buy mobility scooters for fellow veterans. Others said the app provided a platform to launch small businesses or discuss topics such as eldercare and mental health. TikTok covered the group\\'s travel and accommodation expenses. The company bused the influencers on Wednesday to the Capitol grounds, where they gathered on a scenic rooftop to shoot their own videos and stand for journalists\\' interviews. After threats of banning the app started during the Trump administration, the company has spent recent years building a U.S.-based security apparatus to wall off U.S. user data and give officials the ability to inspect the computer code that recommends a steady feed of videos to users. TikTok stars were a crucial factor in the company\\'s successful effort to fight off a proposed ban during the Trump years. Whether they will have the same influence this time around remains to be seen. \"I\\'m aware of the popularity of the platform. I\\'m not oblivious,\" said Rep. Yvette Clarke (D., N.Y.), a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee who hasn\\'t yet taken a position on a potential ban. \"However, it\\'s important to weigh our equities here. National security has to be addressed.\" Ahead of Mr. Chew\\'s appearance, TikTok has ramped up lobbying efforts with the help of Oracle Corp., its U.S. data-security partner. Advertisements at the capital\\'s Metro subway stops tout the company\\'s commitment to user safety.',\n",
       "  'The most memorable event of the 2023 baseball season took place on Tuesday night, over a week before the MLB regular season is set to begin. With a full count and two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning of a one-run game, Los Angeles Angels superstar Shohei Ohtani stood on the mound in Miami and faced his Angels teammate, Mike Trout. It was the U.S. against Japan in the title game of the World Baseball Classic. But it was also the marquee moment baseball fans have been hoping to see since Ohtani made his MLB debut in 2018: The two greatest baseball players in the world, performing in a high-leverage moment in a championship game. The twist was that they were opponents, not teammates. \"The baseball world won tonight,\" said Team USA manager Mark DeRosa after Japan\\'s 3-2 victory in the final. Ohtani didn\\'t spare Trout in his effort to close out the victory for Japan. He set up the at-bat with a sweeping slider, then fired off four consecutive fastballs to Trout, all around 100 miles per hour or faster. Ohtani struck Trout out swinging on another sweeping slider, ending the game, the tournament, and setting up quite a scenario in the Angels clubhouse when the two report back to spring training this week. \"This was probably the funnest 10 days I\\'ve ever had,\" Trout said after the game. As a member of the Angels, he has only appeared briefly in the MLB playoffs once. Ohtani hasn\\'t appeared in the playoffs at all. Ohtani won the battle against Trout, but the two typically stolid superstars spent the tournament showing big emotions as they each worked their way toward that final at-bat. Trout was the first to reach base against Japan, legging out a first-inning double and giving an emphatic salute as he found himself safe. Ohtani was the engine of Team Japan, delivering a pregame speech to his teammates in the clubhouse before the final game of the tournament. The two players have to this point spent their MLB careers mostly languishing in Anaheim, with the chance to compete for a championship maddeningly out of reach. In this matchup, Trout and Ohtani weren\\'t just given the opportunities to experience baseball on a big stage. They were clear leaders for their respective teams. The chance to see the longtime teammates face off against one another represented the best that international baseball has to offer. \"This is the greatest game in the world,\" Angels manager Phil Nevin said after watching his star players from Arizona. \"No other sport can bring drama like baseball.\" Earlier in the tournament, it was expected that Ohtani would pitch in a quarterfinals game then return to spring training to make an exhibition start to line him up for opening day. When Japan reached the WBC final, the Angels authorized him to depart from his typical routine to be available to pitch against the U.S. Now, he closed out the tournament and won its MVP, and is still on track to take the ball on Angels opening day. This year\\'s WBC turned out to be a massive success for MLB -- even accounting for major injuries to Mets closer Edwin Diaz (out for the season with a knee injury) and Astros second baseman Jose Altuve (broken thumb after being hit by a pitch). They were reminders of the risk of playing full-effort games in March. The tournament turned out to have high-energy, competitive games, and the final matchup of USA-Japan was undoubtedly a pairing of baseball powerhouses. The WBC will return in 2026, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred told reporters in Miami on Tuesday. \"The World Series is always gonna be the World Series,\" Manfred said. \"This is a different kind of competition. We do it to grow the game and internationalize the game.\" Ohtani was named the tournament\\'s MVP after hitting .435, with a .606 on base percentage and a .739 slugging percentage in seven games for Japan. He also had a 1.86 ERA in three appearances -- two starts and his appearance as the closer in the final. The tournament furthered his status as an international spectacle, and he wept on the field as he lined up with the rest of Team Japan to be honored during the trophy ceremony. Ohtani and Trout, along with Team Mexico pitcher Patrick Sandoval, will return to the Angels clubhouse with plenty of material for trash talking and an early-season taste of championship excitement. Whether the experience will benefit the Angels remains to be seen. They still face tough competition this season, particularly against the defending champion Astros in the American League West. MLB\\'s regular season begins a week from Thursday, and players who faced one another in the WBC will be reunited as teammates for the long season marathon. For years, baseball wanted to see Ohtani and Trout playing on a big stage. They got there as opponents, but the next step for their careers will be getting there as teammates.',\n",
       "  'WASHINGTON -- TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Zi Chew has navigated both Western and Chinese business over the course of his fast rise to the corner office. That cultural straddle has helped land him the top job at one of the world\\'s biggest tech companies. His background may now help him connect with a skeptical American Congress. Many members have threatened to ban TikTok, saying its Chinese ownership poses a national-security threat. On Thursday, the 40-year-old Singaporean Army reservist and former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker is slated to appear before a House panel to argue against a ban and reassure Americans their data are safe and Beijing won\\'t be able to influence what viewers see on TikTok. Born and raised in Singapore, then educated in London and at Harvard Business School, Mr. Chew spent some of his early career cutting deals for a venture-capital firm in Asia. He then quickly moved to the C-suite as the chief financial officer of a Chinese smartphone giant at age 32. He runs TikTok from offices in Singapore but travels often, including frequently to the U.S. He met his wife, a Taiwanese-American who grew up in Bethesda, Md., at Harvard. Relatively unknown for the boss of one of the world\\'s mostpopular apps, Mr. Chew will be asked to defend the company in front of some of its more skeptical critics on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Aides to the Republicans who control the committee say there is essentially nothing Mr. Chew can saythat would change their mindsas they threaten a nationwideban. In an interview from the company\\'s WeWork offices in Washington, he said he views Thursday\\'s hearing as a chance to explain what TikTok is trying to do and to get feedback from Congress members -- not a last-gasp effort to save TikTok\\'sAmerican business. \"I look at it as an opportunity to do that, not a do-or-die\" moment, he said. The corporate stakes for Mr. Chew are as high as they get for a CEO facing such an appearance in Washington. Some Congress members from both major parties are pushing for a nationwide ban of the video app, citing national-security threats. The Biden administration isdemanding TikTok divestitself from its Chinese parent, ByteDance Ltd., or face such a ban. Critics say China could force TikTok to hand over American user data or influence what American viewers see on the app. TikTok has said it has never received such a request and would refuse to comply with one. Mr. Chew took over the top job afterKevin Mayer,a high-profile Walt Disney Co. alum, left his post after three months, while the Trump administration pursued an earlier effort to force a sale of TikTok to U.S. investors. He is a native English speaker who, like most Singaporeans, is of Chinese ancestry. His father worked in construction and his mother in bookkeeping. He said he was uprooted from a modest upbringing at age 12, when high marks on a national exam sent him to an elite high school. Mr. Chew was put on an officer track during his mandatory 2 1/2 years of military service. That added 10 years to his eligibility for reserve duty, which ends when he is 50. The hardest physical experience of his life, he said, was the military\\'s five-day survival course in Brunei\\'s jungles. He built a hut, cooked wild yams and trekked 55 miles. At one point during such courses, trainees are given a live quail that they can kill with their hands before skinning and cooking it. In the interview, Mr. Chew didn\\'t want to discuss what he did with his bird. After the military, Mr. Chew attended University College London and remained in the British capital to work as a banker for Goldman Sachs. Following an internship at Meta Platforms Inc.\\'s Facebook and business school, Mr. Chew worked for venture-capital firm DST Global. His high-school-level Mandarin qualified him to be its China-focused partner. In 2012, he visited the Chinese equivalent of a Silicon Valley garage: an apartment in Beijing\\'s university district. Thirty people, including a chef, crammed in to develop an app that suggested news articles to people based on factors such as how much time they spent on previous stories. The company was ByteDance, which would go on to create TikTok. Its founder, Zhang Yiming, won over Mr. Chew. He and his partners invested in the company. \"The idea is so simple but so powerful: that you should be looking at content not based on who you know, but really based on your own behavior,\" Mr. Chew said. Another investment Mr. Chew led was in Xiaomi Corp., a Chinese smartphone giant with global ambitions. Xiaomi brought him over first as chief financial officer and then had him run its business outside China.']}"

      "[['MY FIRST EXPERIENCE with city cycling wasn\\'t promising. The suburban rides of my childhood hadn\\'t prepared me for crumbling concrete, hulking cargo trucks and hostile drivers. By the time I moved to New York City six years ago, biking seemed absurd. At the start of the pandemic, however, traffic vanished from my neighborhood in Brooklyn and it seemed like everyone took to two wheels. The New York City Department of Transportation reported it tracked 33% more bike trips year-over-year between May and December of 2020. Recently, I realized I was tired of being too scared to join the new wave of cyclists. The data wasn\\'t encouraging. American streets are dangerous places, even in a two-ton box of steel. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said the U.S. had the highest per capita rate of deaths from road accidents among the 38 countries from its data set in 2021, the most recent year for which it has statistics. Explore buy side from WSJ And cyclists face considerable threats. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported that fatal injuries to cyclists went up by 9.2% between 2019 and 2020, and by another 5.2% by the end of the 2021. Sheryl Porter, a 52-year-old stay-at-home mom in Grand Prairie, Texas, told me drivers sometimes play \"Chicken\" with her. More chilling, Mark Lowe, 49, a physician assistant in Aurora, Colo., said he once had a driver ride beside him, roll down his window and aim a handgun in his face. And yet, both bike a lot. Veon McReynolds, 71, a retired university administrator, said the key to staying safe is treating cars like dogs. \"If you come up to a dog and feel like it\\'s going to bite you, you\\'ll approach that dog a lot differently.\" He said even drivers in Houston, full of six-lane highways, respect cyclists who look comfortable and regularly look behind them. Dressing the part can also help. Though some studies indicate that drivers give cyclists with helmets less room, most people I talked to always wear one. Most also ride with front- and taillights, both to be more visible and ensure they can spot hazards. After buying a helmet, I borrowed a bike and tried projecting confidence in a small loop in my neighborhood. I\\'m sure I resembled a giraffe calf, awkwardly shifting my weight to find balance. But for the most part, car drivers gave me a wide berth. It felt a lot less scary than I\\'d imagined. For advice more-specific to New York, I took a lesson with Bike New York, a not-for-profit that hosts free classes for cyclists of all ages and experience levels. Rich Conroy, director of education, taught me how to make sure my bike was in good shape before I rode, watched me practice a graceful stop (the trick is to press down on your brakes gradually, not too hard or too quickly), and showed me how to deploy my bike\\'s gears to crush hills. The most useful lesson, however, was the \"power start.\" When stopped at a light, put the foot of your dominant leg on the ground, and keep the other on the pedal, held parallel with the bottom tube. When the light turns green, push off the ground hard, then down on the pedal. You\\'ll zoom. Since my lesson, I\\'ve encountered some unexpected annoyances like construction and tricky intersections. More than once, I\\'ve had to raise my voice to get the attention of a driver who was seemingly scrolling through TikTok. But I\\'ve avoided tragedy. I zipped down to a coffee shop to meet a friend. I corralled a group into crossing the Manhattan Bridge, with the promise of dumplings in Chinatown. Even pedaling to Bike Plant, a shop by my house, to buy gloves felt like an adventure. Of course, New York\\'s bike infrastructure is relatively good. You can easily navigate from bike lane to bike lane. This wasn\\'t the case circa 2000. \"Biking in New York City used to look like a cross between a \\'70s disaster film and \\'Mad Max,\\'\" said Janette Sadik-Khan, currently a principal at Bloomberg Associates, a philanthropic consulting firm. Then the streets were filled with potholes, glass and loose gravel. In 2007, she became the NYC DOT commissioner, with a mandate to reshape the streets to be safer and more friendly to pedestrians, buses and cyclists. Ms. Sadik-Khan said she aimed to create connected networks of bike paths, so that you could go from path to path on your way anywhere, minimizing the amount of time you had to bike in the flow of car traffic. Since she left the department in 2013, the city has continued this work. New York now has over 1,500 miles of dedicated bike lanes. The proliferation has dramatically increased cycling traffic, but NYC DOT data collected between 2000 and 2018 indicates the infrastructure improvements have reduced the risk of severe injury and death to cyclists by 80% . Similar changes might be coming to streets near you in the wake of the pandemic biking boom. According to estimates from StreetLight Data, a mobility analytics research firm, at least 15 U.S. cities saw a staggering 50% year-over-year growth in bicycling between September 2019 and the same month in 2020, including centers like Omaha, Neb., Little Rock, Ark., and Birmingham, Ala. Streets in some cities have been closed to car traffic. All the while, splashy bike-lane projects are under way in places like Providence, R.I., and Bloomington, Ind. I\\'m ready to try them all. Especially now that it\\'s spring. BELLS AND WHISTLES A few accessories to help keep you safe, and ensure you don\\'t spend so much time fretting about losing your bike that you never leave home 1. Agreeable Alerter If you haven\\'t used a bell since your tricycle days, get one—they\\'re an easy way to signal your presence to pedestrians and drivers. The Spurcycle Bell ($59) is remarkably resonant, which means people will even hear it from inside their SUVs. 2. Hard Hat Many new helmets like the Giro Register ($70) are designed with an extra internal liner, which can minimize the amount of rotational forces your head experiences in a crash. Helmets with this feature will have a yellow sticker that says \"MIPS\" on the side. I\\'ve also been using an attached EVT Helmet Mirror ($40), which improves my spatial awareness, though it\\'s no substitute for looking back. 3. Theft Protection While you can certainly use a regular Bluetooth tracker like the Tile Sticker with your bike, the Knog Scout ($60) is designed to be mounted more stealthily. It\\'s fully waterproof and can produce an extremely loud sound if you deem your bike lost. 4. Pump it Up In the case of a flat tire, you\\'ll always want to keep a patch kit (like the TT02 from Rema Tip Top ($3.50)) and bike pump on hand. The Topeak Mini ($40) is bitty and light (only 6 ounces), but has a foldout foot pad that makes it easy to use. 5. Infinite Illumination Front and rear lighting help you both see and be seen. The Sinewave Beacon 2 ($350) is a front light that works in conjunction with a Dynamo hub, which, when installed to your wheel, captures some of the energy you use to pedal and converts it to electricity. This makes the Beacon a light you\\'ll never have to recharge. Bonus: it has a USB port for juicing up your phone. 6. Major Key It\\'s a bad idea to leave your bike unlocked in the city, obviously. The Kryptonite New-U New York Lock ($148) features a double deadbolt. For thieves to get your bike, they would have to saw through each arm individually. Most won\\'t bother with the hassle.

Prop styling by Jacqueline Draper for This Represents; Model: Joseph Oxley MORE IN GEAR & GADGETS', 'Sam Altman, the 37-year-old startup-minting guru at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom , has long dreamed of a future in which computers could converse and learn like humans. One of his clearest childhood memories is sitting up late in his bedroom in suburban St. Louis, playing with the Macintosh LC II he had gotten for his eighth birthday when he had the sudden realization: \"Someday, the computer was going to learn to think,\" he said. In recent months, Mr. Altman has done more than anyone else to usher in this future—and commercialize it. OpenAI, the company he leads, in November released ChatGPT , the chatbot with an uncanny ability to produce humanlike writing that has become one of the most viral products in the history of technology. In the process, OpenAI went from a small nonprofit into a multibillion-dollar company , at near record speed, thanks in part to the launch of a for-profit arm that enabled it to raise $13 billion from Microsoft Corp., according to investor documents. This success has come as part of a delicate balancing act. Mr. Altman said he fears what could happen if AI is rolled out into society recklessly. He co-founded OpenAI eight years ago as a research nonprofit, arguing that it\\'s uniquely dangerous to have profits be the main driver of developing powerful AI models. He is so wary of profit as an incentive in AI development that he has taken no direct financial stake in the business he built, he said—an anomaly in Silicon Valley, where founders of successful startups typically get rich off their equity. \"Like most other people, I like watching scores go up,\" when it comes to financial gains, he said. \"And I just like not having that be any factor at all.\" (The company said he earns a \"modest\" salary, but declined to disclose how much.) Mr. Altman said he has a small stake in a venture fund that invested in OpenAI, but that it is \"immaterial.\" Mr. Altman said he made \"more money than I could ever need\" early in his career, when he made a fortune investing in young startups. He owns three homes, including a mansion in San Francisco\\'s Russian Hill neighborhood and a weekend home in Napa Valley, and employs a couple dozen to manage them and his family office of investments and nonprofits. During one of his last visits to his grandmother, who died last year, he bought her groceries and then admitted to his mother that he hadn\\'t been to a grocery store in four or five years, she said. His goal, he said, is to forge a new world order in which machines free people to pursue more creative work. In his vision, universal basic income—the concept of a cash stipend for everyone, no strings attached—helps compensate for jobs replaced by AI. Mr. Altman even thinks that humanity will love AI so much that an advanced chatbot could represent \"an extension of your will.\" In the long run, he said, he wants to set up a global governance structure that would oversee decisions about the future of AI and gradually reduce the power OpenAI\\'s executive team has over its technology. Backers say his brand of social-minded capitalism makes him the ideal person to lead OpenAI. Others, including some who\\'ve worked for him, say he\\'s too commercially minded and immersed in Silicon Valley thinking to lead a technological revolution that is already reshaping business and social life. The company signed a $10 billion deal with Microsoft in January that would allow the tech behemoth to own 49% of the company\\'s for-profit entity, investor documents show. The corporate partnership, along with Mr. Altman\\'s push to more aggressively commercialize its technology, have disillusioned key early leaders at OpenAI who felt the decisions violated an initial commitment to develop AI outside the influence of shareholders. One of OpenAI\\'s critics has been Elon Musk, who co-founded the nonprofit in 2015 but parted ways in 2018 after a dispute over its control and direction. The Tesla Inc. CEO tweeted in February that OpenAI had been founded as an open-source nonprofit \"to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft. Not what I intended at all.\" Mr. Altman paused when asked about his co-founder\\'s critique. \"I like Elon,\" he finally responded. \"I pay attention to what he has to say.\" In an open letter made public this week, Mr. Musk and other Silicon Valley luminaries, including Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a six-month pause for developing AI more advanced than GPT-4, the latest technology released by OpenAI in March, to stem a technological race that could spiral out of control. Mr. Altman said he doesn\\'t necessarily need to be first to develop artificial general intelligence, a world long imagined by researchers and science-fiction writers where software isn\\'t just good at one specific task like generating text or images but can understand and learn as well or better than a human can. He instead said OpenAI\\'s ultimate mission is to build AGI, as it\\'s called, safely. OpenAI has set profit caps for investors, with any returns beyond certain levels—from seven to 100 times what they put in, depending on how early they invested—flowing to the nonprofit parent, according to investor documents. OpenAI and Microsoft also created a joint safety board, which includes Mr. Altman and Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott, that has the power to roll back Microsoft and OpenAI product releases if they are deemed too dangerous. The possibilities of AGI have led Mr. Altman to entertain the idea that some similar technology created our universe, according to billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel, a close friend of Mr. Altman\\'s and an early donor to the nonprofit. He has long been a proponent of the idea that humans and machines will one day merge. ChatGPT\\'s release triggered a stream of competing AI announcements. \"They\\'ve raced to release press releases,\" Mr. Altman said of his competitors. \"Obviously, they\\'re behind now.\" Google announced it was testing its own chatbot, Bard, in February and opened access to the public in March. In its founding charter, OpenAI pledged to abandon its research efforts if another project came close to building AGI before it did. The goal, the company said, was to avoid a race toward building dangerous AI systems fueled by competition and instead prioritize the safety of humanity. OpenAI\\'s headquarters, in San Francisco\\'s Mission District, evoke an affluent New Age utopia more than a nonprofit trying to save the world. Stone fountains are nestled amid succulents and ferns in nearly all of the sun-soaked rooms. Mr. Altman gushes about the winding, central staircase he conceived so that all 400 of the company\\'s employees would have a chance to pass each other daily—or at least on the Mondays through Wednesdays they are required to work in-person. The office includes a college-style cafeteria, a self-serve bar and a library modeled after a combination of his favorite bookstore in Paris and the Bender Room, a quiet study space on the top floor of Stanford University\\'s largest library. Dressed in the typical tech CEO uniform of a gray hoodie, jeans and blindingly white sneakers, Mr. Altman described a much more modest upbringing. Mr. Altman grew up in a suburb of St. Louis, the eldest of four children born to Connie Gibstine, a dermatologist, and Jerry Altman, who worked various jobs, including as a lawyer, and died five years ago. The senior Mr. Altman\\'s true vocation was running affordable housing nonprofits, his family said, and he spent years trying to revitalize St. Louis\\'s downtown. Among the lessons his father taught him, Mr. Altman said, was that \"you always help people—even if you don\\'t think you have time, you figure it out.\" Dr. Gibstine said her son was working the family\\'s VCR at age 2 and rebooking his own plane ticket home from camp at 13. By the time he was in third grade, he was helping teachers at his local public school troubleshoot computer problems, she said. In middle school, he transferred to the private John Burroughs School. \"Teachers liked him because he was really, really bright and a hard worker, but he was also super social,\" said Andy Abbott, the head of school, who was a principal at the time. \"He was funny and had a big personality.\" Mr. Altman went on to Stanford, where he did research at an AI lab. By sophomore year he had co-founded Loopt, a location-based social networking service. It became part of the first class of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator that went on to hatch companies like Airbnb Inc., Stripe Inc. and Dropbox Inc., and Mr. Altman left school. Loopt never got traction, selling in 2012 for $43.4 million, or close to the amount investors including Sequoia Capital put in. Mr. Altman then started a venture fund and made powerful allies, including Mr. Thiel and Paul Graham, who co-founded Y Combinator and eventually brought on Mr. Altman. There he helped build the company into a Silicon Valley power broker. He invested his own money in dozens of successful companies early on, including cloud software company Asana Inc. and message-board site Reddit Inc. While running Y Combinator, Mr. Altman began to nurse a growing fear that large research labs like DeepMind, purchased by Google in 2014, were creating potentially dangerous AI technologies outside the public eye. Mr. Musk has voiced similar concerns of a dystopian world controlled by powerful AI machines. Messrs. Altman and Musk decided it was time to start their own lab. Both were part of a group that pledged $1 billion to the nonprofit, OpenAI Inc. Mr. Musk didn\\'t respond to requests for comment. The nonprofit meandered in its early years, experimenting with projects like teaching robots how to perform tasks like solving Rubik\\'s Cubes. OpenAI laid off a chunk of its small staff in 2017. OpenAI researchers soon concluded that the most promising path to achieve artificial general intelligence rested in large language models, or computer programs that mimic the way humans read and write. Such models were trained on large volumes of text and required a massive amount of computing power that OpenAI wasn\\'t equipped to fund as a nonprofit, according to Mr. Altman. \"We didn\\'t have a visceral sense of just how expensive this project was going to be,\" he said. \"We still don\\'t.\" That year, Mr. Altman said he looked into options to raise more money for OpenAI, such as securing federal funding and launching a new cryptocurrency. \"No one wanted to fund this in any way,\" he said. \"It was a really hard time.\" Tensions also grew with Mr. Musk, who became frustrated with the slow progress and pushed for more control over the organization, people familiar with the matter said. OpenAI executives ended up reviving an unusual idea that had been floated earlier in the company\\'s history: creating a for-profit arm, OpenAI LP, that would report to the nonprofit parent. Reid Hoffman, a LinkedIn co-founder who advised OpenAI at the time and later served on the board, said the idea was to attract investors eager to make money from the commercial release of some OpenAI technology, accelerating OpenAI\\'s progress. \"You want to be there first and you want to be setting the norms,\" he said. \"That\\'s part of the reason why speed is a moral and ethical thing here.\" The decision further alienated Mr. Musk, the people familiar with the matter said. He parted ways with OpenAI in February 2018. Mr. Musk announced his departure in a company all-hands, former employees who attended the meeting said. Mr. Musk explained that he thought he had a better chance at creating artificial general intelligence through Tesla, where he had access to greater resources, they said. A young researcher questioned whether Mr. Musk had thought through the safety implications, the former employees said. Mr. Musk grew visibly frustrated and called the intern a \"jackass,\" leaving employees stunned, they said. It was the last time many of them would see Mr. Musk in person. Soon after, an OpenAI executive commissioned a \"jackass\" trophy for the young researcher, which was later presented to him on a pillow. \"You\\'ve got to have a little fun,\" Mr. Altman said. \"This is the stuff that culture gets made out of.\" Mr. Musk\\'s departure marked a turning point. Later that year, OpenAI leaders told employees that Mr. Altman was set to lead the company. He formally became CEO and helped complete the creation of the for-profit subsidiary in early 2019. OpenAI said that it received about $130 million in contributions from the initial $1 billion pledge, but that further donations were no longer needed after the for-profit\\'s creation. Mr. Musk has tweeted that he donated around $100 million to OpenAI. In the meantime, Mr. Altman began hunting for investors. His break came at Allen & Co.\\'s annual conference in Sun Valley, Idaho in the summer of 2018, where he bumped into Satya Nadella, the Microsoft CEO, on a stairwell and pitched him on OpenAI. Mr. Nadella said he was intrigued. The conversations picked up that winter. \"I remember coming back to the team after and I was like, this is the only partner,\" Mr. Altman said. \"They get the safety stuff, they get artificial general intelligence. They have the capital, they have the ability to run the compute.\" Mr. Altman shared the contract with employees as it was being negotiated, hosting all-hands and office hours to allay concerns that the partnership contradicted OpenAI\\'s initial pledge to develop artificial intelligence outside the corporate world, the former employees said. Some employees still saw the deal as a Faustian bargain. OpenAI\\'s lead safety researcher, Dario Amodei, and his lieutenants feared the deal would allow Microsoft to sell products using powerful OpenAI technology before it was put through enough safety testing, former employees said. They felt that OpenAI\\'s technology was far from ready for a large release—let alone with one of the world\\'s largest software companies—worrying it could malfunction or be misused for harm in ways they couldn\\'t predict. Mr. Amodei also worried the deal would tether OpenAI\\'s ship to just one company—Microsoft—making it more difficult for OpenAI to stay true to its founding charter\\'s commitment to assist another project if it got to AGI first, the former employees said. Microsoft initially invested $1 billion in OpenAI. While the deal gave OpenAI its needed money, it came with a hitch: exclusivity. OpenAI agreed to only use Microsoft\\'s giant computer servers, via its Azure cloud service, to train its AI models, and to give the tech giant the sole right to license OpenAI\\'s technology for future products. \"You kind of have to jump off the cliff and hope you land,\" Mr. Nadella said in a recent interview. \"That\\'s kind of how platform shifts happen.\" \"The deal completely undermines those tenets to which they secured nonprofit status,\" said Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of psychology and neural science at New York University who co-founded a machine-learning company. Mr. Altman \"has presided over a 180-degree pivot that seems to me to be only giving lip service to concern for humanity,\" he said. Mr. Altman disagreed. \"The unusual thing about Microsoft as a partner is that it let us keep all the tenets that we think are important to our mission,\" he said, including profit caps and the commitment to assist another project if it got to AGI first. The cash turbocharged OpenAI\\'s progress, giving researchers access to the computing power needed to improve large language models, which were trained on billions of pages of publicly available text. OpenAI soon developed a more powerful language model called GPT-3 and then sold developers access to the technology in June 2020 through packaged lines of code known as application program interfaces, or APIs. Mr. Altman and Mr. Amodei clashed again over the release of the API, former employees said. Mr. Amodei wanted a more limited and staged release of the product to help reduce publicity and allow the safety team to conduct more testing on a smaller group of users, former employees said. Mr. Amodei left the company a few months later along with several others to found a rival AI lab called Anthropic. \"They had a different opinion about how to best get to safe AGI than we did,\" Mr. Altman said. Anthropic has since received more than $300 million from Google this year and released its own AI chatbot called Claude in March, which is also available to developers through an API. In a recent investment deck, Anthropic said it was \"committed to large-scale commercialization\" to achieve the creation of safe AGI, and that it \"fully committed\" to a commercial approach in September. The company was founded as an AI safety and research company and said at the time that it might look to create commercial value from its products. In the three years after the initial deal, Microsoft invested a total of $3 billion in OpenAI, according to investor documents. More than one million users signed up for ChatGPT within five days of its November release, a speed that surprised even Mr. Altman. It followed the company\\'s introduction of DALL-E 2 , which can generate sophisticated images from text prompts. The internet blew up with anecdotes about people using ChatGPT to create sonnets or plan toddler birthday parties. By February, it had reached 100 million users, according to analysts at UBS, the fastest pace by a consumer app in history to reach that mark. Mr. Altman\\'s close associates praise his ability to balance OpenAI\\'s priorities. No one better navigates between the \"Scylla of misplaced idealism\" and the \"Charybdis of myopic ambition,\" Mr. Thiel said. Mr. Altman said he delayed the release of the latest version of its model, GPT-4, from last year to March to run additional safety tests. Users had reported some disturbing experiences with the model, integrated into Bing, where the software hallucinated—meaning it made up answers to questions it didn\\'t know. It issued ominous warnings and made threats. \"The way to get it right is to have people engage with it, explore these systems, study them, to learn how to make them safe,\" Mr. Altman said. After Microsoft\\'s initial investment is paid back, it would capture 49% of OpenAI\\'s profits until the profit cap, up from 21% under prior arrangements, the documents show. OpenAI Inc., the nonprofit parent, would get the rest. Mr. Altman\\'s other projects include Worldcoin, a company he co-founded that seeks to give cryptocurrency to every person on earth. He has put almost all his liquid wealth in recent years in two companies. He has put $375 million into Helion Energy, which is seeking to create carbon-free energy from nuclear fusion and is close to creating \"legitimate net-gain energy in a real demo,\" Mr. Altman said. He has also put $180 million into Retro, which aims to add 10 years to the human lifespan through \"cellular reprogramming, plasma-inspired therapeutics and autophagy,\" or the reuse of old and damaged cell parts, according to the company. He noted how much easier these problems are, morally, than AI. \"If you\\'re making nuclear fusion, it\\'s all upside. It\\'s just good,\" he said. \"If you\\'re making AI, it is potentially very good, potentially very terrible.\" Deepa Seetharaman and Miles Kruppa contributed to this article. Write to Berber Jin at berber.jin@wsj.com and Keach Hagey at Keach.Hagey@wsj.com', 'WASHINGTON—The Biden administration detailed new criteria for an electric-vehicle tax-credit program , a change that officials said they expect will reduce the number of eligible models. The new rules, issued by the Treasury Department Friday, aim to make the U.S. less reliant on batteries and critical minerals shipped from China. For car buyers to claim the full $7,500 tax credit, the batteries must contain set amounts of components made in North America and critical minerals sourced in the U.S. or from certain friendly countries. The criteria will take effect on April 18, when a list of models that qualify for the tax credit will be issued. Until then, consumers can claim the full tax credit when they buy vehicles that are currently eligible, before some are expected to drop off the list. The program is part of the Inflation Reduction Act, a broad clean-energy, tax and healthcare law passed last year. It is designed to make electric vehicles more affordable and accelerate the shift to clean energy by updating a previous tax-credit program. John Bozzella, president and chief executive of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a top auto industry group, said only few of the electric-vehicle models that are currently for sale will qualify for the full $7,500 credit under the new criteria. Mr. Bozzella added that he doesn\\'t yet know which makes and models will. Individual auto makers will report to the government in the coming days which models meet the mineral and battery-component requirements. Currently, 43% of electric vehicles on the market are eligible for the tax credit, down from 92% before the IRA last August required that vehicles be manufactured in North America, according to the alliance. \"In fact, this period may go down as the high water mark for EV tax credit eligibility since the IRA passed last year,\" Mr. Bozzella said in a blog post. More than 282,000 electric vehicles were sold in the U.S. in the October-December quarter last year, up 51% from a year earlier and making up 8.5% of all vehicle sales, the group said. Steven Schmoll, a director at KPMG, said anyone in the market for an electric vehicle should consider whether the critical mineral and battery component requirements would apply: \"There could be a $7,500 difference between taking possession of an EV on April 17 versus April 18.\" Writing the new rules has been a headache for the Biden administration, under pressure from trading partners that said the legislation would harm their auto makers . Some allies said they are still negotiating with U.S. officials to make sure they are covered by a key aspect of the rules. While companies have increased assembly of electric vehicles and batteries in the U.S., China dominates the global critical-minerals supply . \"Put simply, we want to end this overreliance,\" an administration official said. \"And we now have tools in our tool belt.\" Part of the Inflation Reduction Act\\'s electric-vehicle tax-credit program went into effect on Jan. 1 , without the critical-mineral and battery-component rules. Until mid-April, all electric vehicles assembled in North America and priced below certain levels—$80,000 for sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks, and $55,000 for other vehicles—will be eligible for the full $7,500 credit. Currently, over 20 models qualify. When the new rules kick in, a vehicle will need to meet the critical-mineral rule to be eligible for $3,750 of the tax credit. That requires at least 40% of battery minerals, based on value, to be extracted or processed in the U.S. or countries that have free-trade agreements with the U.S., or recycled in North America. That ratio will rise to 80% by 2027. To qualify for the rest of credit, vehicles will have to meet the battery-component criteria—at least 50% manufactured or assembled in North America, climbing to 100% by 2029. The guidance released Friday spells out how companies should calculate these percentages. The program has income caps of $300,000 for married couples, $225,000 for heads of households and $150,000 for others. Friday\\'s rules make clear that corporations and other entities that don\\'t report adjusted gross income are eligible for the credit, though many may prefer to use a credit for commercial vehicles that has fewer restrictions. A separate program for commercial vehicles offers tax incentives without local-assembly or battery-sourcing requirements, making a wider range of vehicles eligible for the benefit if they are bought by businesses for leasing or rental. Administration officials expect the number of vehicles for which consumers can claim the full tax credit to decline temporarily with the introduction of the new criteria. In the long term, they say new domestic vehicle and battery plants being built by U.S. and foreign companies will mean more cars will be eligible. Since the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act, companies have announced plans to build 75 facilities with a total investment of more than $45 billion, administration officials say. The new proposed rules were rolled out three months after the original target date, as administration officials tried to address concerns raised by trading partners and lawmakers. Although the guidance takes effect next month, it isn\\'t final and will go through a 60-day public-comment period. Some lawmakers say the Treasury Department has interpreted the law too broadly. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), the author of the EV program, criticized the administration\\'s reading of the law in the new rules, saying it allowed for more participation of foreign companies than intended. \"It is horrific that the administration continues to ignore the purpose of the law, which is to bring manufacturing back to America and ensure we have reliable and secure supply chains,\" he said. \"American tax dollars should not be used to support manufacturing jobs overseas.\" The EV rule also has prompted spats with allies, including the European Union, South Korea, Japan and the U.K., which said the local-assembly and battery-sourcing requirements discriminate against their companies. Complaining that the U.S. subsidy program will redirect business investments from Europe to North America, the EU recently beefed up its own clean-energy subsidies . The Treasury Department listed more than 20 countries, including Australia, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, as free-trade agreement countries that qualify under the critical-minerals rule. While a recent announcement to forge a bilateral critical-minerals agreement added Japan to the list, the EU and the U.K. remain ineligible. \"We\\'re quite optimistic that we can reach an agreement of the same sort of substantial scope as the Japanese,\" Margrethe Vestager, the EU\\'s executive vice president and commissioner for competition, said Thursday. Ms. Vestager met Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in Washington Friday. The deal with Japan has drawn pushback from some lawmakers. House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R., Mo.) said the administration was negotiating \"fake trade agreements in secret without approval by Congress.\" The administration will later issue guidance on another key aspect of the electric-vehicle program: a rule on \"foreign entities of concern,\" which will make vehicles ineligible for the tax credits starting next year if their batteries contain any components or critical minerals sourced from an entity linked to China or other adversaries. This is seen as an especially high hurdle for auto makers, as numerous joint-venture operations between companies from China and companies from the U.S. and friendly nations currently play significant roles in EV-battery supply chains. —Andrew Duehren contributed to this article. Write to Yuka Hayashi at Yuka.Hayashi@wsj.com and Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com', 'Wall Street projected an oil bonanza this year. The first quarter upended those expectations. Russia has continued pumping out petroleum despite Western sanctions . The U.S. market has remained awash in crude after the conclusion of the Biden administration\\'s emergency release of oil reserves . And a Chinese rebound that underpinned some analysts\\' predictions of a commodity boom has yet to juice global demand. Instead, the oil producers and traders that captured monster profits in 2022 are now weighing whether a slowdown in the U.S. and Europe is coming sooner rather than later—if it comes at all. The tremors at Western bank s in March magnified that uncertainty , leaving investors wading through complicated crosscurrents running from financial markets to the real world. The banking stress led to oil\\'s steepest weekly selloff since the beginning of the pandemic and took some of the sheen off energy stocks, one of the market\\'s major winners in 2022. The S&P 500 energy sector slid 5.6% in the first quarter, according to FactSet, a decline outpaced only by financial stocks. Some investors now fear that crude\\'s China-driven rally could be slowed by an unpredictable outlook for U.S. and European industries heavily reliant on gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Khendry Veras, a vice president at On Time Logistics, a family-owned trucking company in Newark, N.J., said falling fuel costs in recent months haven\\'t made up for dwindling shipping-container deliveries for its fleet of 40 semitrailers that haul freight up and down the East Coast. \"We\\'re doing our best to hold on,\" Mr. Veras said. During a year in which many on Wall Street projected the value of oil to jump, allowing the energy industry to shower shareholders with more cash, the outlook of oil-and-gas executives has turned negative, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey of 147 companies. Benchmark U.S. prices, meanwhile, have slipped 5.7%. \"The price moves that we\\'ve seen have played out because, to a good extent, the elements that were expected to be bullish have turned out to be bearish,\" said Matt Smith, an analyst at the ship-tracking firm Kpler. For now, many physical trading houses and hedge funds that speculate on oil continue to see upside in China, parsing shipping routes, traffic patterns and air-travel numbers for hints that its postpandemic recovery is gaining steam. The country imported nearly 11.4 million barrels of seaborne oil a day in March, according to Kpler, the second-highest monthly total the firm has recorded. A hiring spree of skyscraper-size supertankers in the coming weeks suggests the uptick could continue. \"It\\'s picking up,\" said Cyril Ducau, chief executive of Singapore-based Eastern Pacific Shipping, which commands a 225-vessel fleet, pointing to growing imports of oil, refined fuel and iron ore. Many investors remain optimistic China will help the broader energy sector continue to pass out dividends and stock buybacks throughout 2023. \"You look at the second half of the year, and global oil demand is reaching all-time highs,\" said Rob Thummel, managing director at Tortoise, an energy-investment firm. For some traders, the big question is whether China\\'s appetite for oil will grow—boosting prices—before the U.S. and European hunger for energy subsides. In the U.S., the overall economy continues to chug along. Fears of broader contagion from the banking stress have receded, and stock markets have rebounded. The Federal Reserve at its meeting in March continued to raise interest rates to cool inflation. But petroleum analysts see at least one warning sign for energy markets. Demand for diesel has dropped nearly 12% from a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration, contributing to unusual growth in U.S. oil stockpiles for much of 2023. That slip in demand has come as some diesel-reliant industries have seen a drop in borrowing and business activity. Companies in construction, agriculture, and metals and mining last year sold less than half the bonds they did in 2021, according to PitchBook LCD, suggesting that financing for new projects is tightening. The manufacturing sector in February reported its sixth straight month of declining orders for products such as carpeting, furniture and appliances. Rising rates have slammed mortgage lending and forced home-building companies to pull back from single-family-home jobs, idling work vehicles and diesel-driven equipment including excavators. \"The single-family housing segment is in its own recession,\" said Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, a construction-industry trade group. Imports from container ships tumbled in recent months as retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corp., Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. pulled back on orders . In Newark, On Time Logistics has responded by cutting employees\\' hours and bracing for furloughs or layoffs if things don\\'t improve. Mr. Veras said the company spent as much as $40,000 a week fueling up on diesel last summer, when there was a steady need for trucks to carry containers of nails, marble and other freight. Diesel\\'s cost per gallon has slid since then, but the number of trips made by On Time Logistics—and the amount of diesel its vehicles use—has dropped even faster. Now, Mr. Veras said, the company\\'s weekly fuel costs have plunged to $10,000 or $15,000. But he is optimistic business will pick back up heading into summer. \"It has got to get better from here on out,\" he said. Write to David Uberti at david.uberti@wsj.com', 'Core inflation in the eurozone hit a record in March, a setback for central bankers whose rapid interest-rate rises have exacerbated financial sector strains and caused pains in part of the bloc\\'s economy. The fresh data increases the likelihood that the European Central Bank will raise its key rate again in May. It could also encourage governments to explore alternative ways to cool prices rises by targeting inflationary increases in profits. The European Union\\'s statistics agency said consumer prices in the eurozone were 6.9% higher in March than a year earlier, a decline from the 8.5% rate of inflation recorded in February and the lowest in just over a year. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal last week had expected to see a decline to 7.1%. The sharp fall in the annual inflation rate was driven by energy prices, which surged in March last year after Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, but have since fallen back. The core rate of inflation however, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose to 5.7% from 5.6%, reaching the highest level since records began in 2001. Central bankers tend to focus on core inflation as an indication of whether rate rises are cooling inflation since it better reflects the balance of demand and supply in the economy. \"This reinforces our view that the ECB will keep hiking in the coming months despite some financial stability concerns,\" economists at HSBC said. As they consider their next steps, policy makers will be aware that further rate rises risk deepening strains in the European banking system. These strains could amplify the impact of interest-rate rises by leading to a sharper decline in lending to businesses and households than the ECB had anticipated. This added stress in the banking system came into sharp relief when Credit Suisse Group AG, weakened by years of scandals and trading losses, came under intense market pressure, prompting Swiss regulators to engineer UBS Group AG\\'s takeover of its rival . That followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the U.S., which brought the challenges of adjusting to a sharp rise in interest rates into focus. Policy makers have long been concerned that the surge in energy and food prices after the invasion of Ukraine would lead to an increase in pay rises, in turn prompting businesses to raise their prices and setting off a fresh round of pay demands. Some ECB rate setters are now also looking at the inflationary potential of widening profit margins, with one official warning of a \"profit-price spiral.\" \"Opportunistic behavior by firms could also delay the fall in core inflation,\" said Fabio Panetta last week. ECB President Christine Lagarde has echoed that concern, saying that a refusal on the part of business owners—not just workers—to accept a decline in their real incomes could entrench high inflation. Since the eurozone imports most of its energy, the sharp rise in energy prices since the months leading up to the invasion of Ukraine is a transfer of resources out of the currency area and to energy suppliers such as Norway, the U.S. and Qatar. In 2022, the European Union\\'s energy imports cost 833.7 billion euros—equivalent to around $909 billion—more than double the €390.3 billion bill for 2021, despite a decline in energy consumption. Eurozone policy makers often compare that loss of resources to a tax rise, and Ms. Lagarde said a sharing of that burden between workers and business owners would help contain inflation. \"It is certainly something that we would welcome, to the extent that it reduces the risk of second-round effects in particular,\" she said earlier this month. Eurozone wages rose at an annual pace of 5.1% during the last quarter of 2022, the fastest rise since records began in 1996, with the exception of the second quarter of 2021, which was boosted by one-off pandemic-related effects. Encouraged by an unemployment rate that fell back to a record low of 6.6% in February, some workers seeking larger pay rises have resorted to strikes. In one of Germany\\'s biggest walkouts in decades, a large-scale transport strike brought large parts of the country to a standstill on Monday as two labor unions sought raises of 10.5% and 12% respectively. Data through the end of 2022 show profits have been rising faster than wages over recent years. And according to the ECB, profits accounted for a larger share of the rise in prices of goods and services than did wages during the final six months of last year. Sectors where the growth in profits has outstripped the growth in wages include manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, accommodation and food services. \"It looks to me as if this inflation shock has encouraged some of these companies to beef up their margins,\" said Claus Vistesen, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Some business owners have said that price rises that exceed cost increases allow companies to keep prices stable, instead of burdening customers with recurrent price increases that closely track inflation. Central bankers don\\'t have any direct way to cool rising profits other than through higher interest rates that weaken demand. Governments can use taxes to cap profit increases more directly. Economists have long pointed to a lack of competition in many of the eurozone\\'s services industries as a drag on growth, but this may now be enabling businesses to claim wider profit margins. \"If there is not enough competition, it\\'s time for regulators to take stock and do something about it,\" said Alvaro Pereira, chief economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. However, regulatory changes can take time to have an impact and ECB policy makers don\\'t appear to be prepared to wait. \"Margin compression will have to happen, playing an important role in the disinflation process,\" said Marco Valli, global head of research at Italy\\'s UniCredit. \"The longer it takes to get there, the higher the risk that the ECB would need to tighten aggressively, pushing the eurozone into the nasty-recession scenario.\" Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com', 'After years of uncertainty, last year\\'s Inflation Reduction Act finally gave America\\'s renewable-energy industry a long, green signal. Now the economy is blocking the road. The wind and solar industries have always suffered from the short-term nature of subsidies, with federal tax credits often extended in nail-biting one-year increments. Last year\\'s climate bill changed that, giving the industry subsidies that last at least a decade. But just as policy winds blow in their favor, two critical growth drivers—interest rates and equipment costs—are moving in the wrong direction. Wind and solar projects are especially sensitive to rates because debt can comprise as much as 85% to 90% of capital expenditures. Renewable developers have known only low rates for most of their history. Nearly all U.S. utility-scale solar facilities and 85% of onshore wind farms were installed since 2009, during which period the target federal-funds rate was close to 0% in eight out of 13 years. Not any more: After the most recent hike , rates are the highest since 2007. Renewable energy projects tend to be financed with floating-rate loans that rise and fall with the benchmark interest rate. Thankfully, most of those projects are well-shielded from rate risk because lenders require them to hedge at least 75% of their loans through swaps, according to Elizabeth Waters, managing director of project finance at MUFG. Most ended up hedging 90-95% to lock in low rates, she noted. But those swaps won\\'t help new projects. Some new solar and wind projects facing higher borrowing costs than when they were planned might not make it off the drawing board. Borrowing isn\\'t the only thing that costs more. Following years of price declines thanks to technology and economies of scale, equipment is getting more expensive too. Trade policies aimed at Chinese manufacturers have caused delays and shortages for the solar industry, which relies heavily on the country for its components. German utility RWE, an active developer in the U.S., said in its annual report released last week that imports of solar modules from Asia are now subject to \"stringent checks\" and said it could fall behind on its expansion plans if the U.S. continues to \"impede the procurement of solar panels.\" After falling to a record low in 2020, the average price of a solar photovoltaic system rose in 2021 and then again in 2022, according to data from the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie. Meanwhile, the average cost to build an onshore wind farm in the U.S. rose in 2020 and 2021 before leveling off last year, according to data from BloombergNEF. Supply-chain issues and interconnection delays already started slowing the clean power industry last year: In 2022 it installed 25.1 Gigawatts of total capacity, a 16% decline from a year earlier, according to the American Clean Power Association, which tracks solar, wind and energy storage. While that\\'s still enough to meet roughly half of Texas\\' electricity demand, it was nonetheless below expectations–though part of the drop was driven by an preplanned phase-down for tax credits commonly used by the wind industry before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed. Ultimately, solar and wind\\'s ability to absorb cost and interest-rate hikes depends on how willing utilities and corporations are to pay higher prices. Many onshore wind and solar projects have been able to renegotiate pricing on their power purchase agreements because demand is robust, according to industry executives. But cracks are showing for offshore wind, which is more exposed to rising costs and rates because it takes longer to develop. BloombergNEF estimates that the weighted average cost of capital for U.S. offshore wind projects rose to 5.25% in 2022 from 4.41% in 2020. Developer Avangrid Renewables, for example, is trying to terminate its power purchase agreement with utilities in Massachusetts for a 1.2 Gigawatt offshore wind project after an unsuccessful attempt at renegotiating its fixed-price contract. If built, Commonwealth Wind would generate enough energy to power 700,000 homes. The company cited \"historic price increases for global commodities, sharp and sudden increases in interest rates, prolonged supply chain constraints, and persistent inflation\" since the project secured a contract in late 2021. Avangrid plans to bid the same project into the state\\'s next competitive offshore wind procurement, a spokesman said over email. Danish power company Orsted said in its annual report released February that it incurred an impairment of 2.5 billion Danish kroner, the equivalent of $369 million, on its 50% interest in the Sunrise Wind project off the coast of New York, noting that the project cost has increased substantially since its bid in 2019. As the name implies, the Inflation Reduction Act is supposed to relieve some of these cost pressures. But it won\\'t feel like a bonanza without clarity on how the rules apply. Expanding the eligibility of tax credits to more technologies, for example, has spread the limited pool of tax equity investors—that is, those with both the tax burden and the know-how to use renewable tax credits—more thinly across more projects. Ironically, that has shrunk the pool of tax equity available to solar and wind in the near term. The bill tries to address this by making such tax credits transferable, but industry executives said that pool of capital will remain constrained until there is more guidance. A solar site in Lumpkin, Ga. PHOTO: Audra Melton for The Wall Street Journal There are two other more recent developments worth watching: One is the plummeting cost of natural gas which, if prolonged, could impact demand for solar and wind on the margins. The U.S. benchmark Henry Hub has fallen 49% year to date. Secondly, banks\\' recent turmoil could shrink their ability to lend. Ted Brandt, chief executive of clean-energy focused investment bank Marathon Capital, notes that the industry has always had cheap debt, cheap equity and \"massive liquidity chasing it.\" How the industry will respond to expensive capital is still an open question, he said. It isn\\'t enough for policy winds to blow in the right direction for a renewable energy boom–economic headwinds need to abate too. Write to Jinjoo Lee at jinjoo.lee@wsj.com More Heard on the Street', 'Consumer spending rose more modestly in February after a sharp jump at the start of the year, while inflation cooled but remained elevated. Households boosted their spending by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in February from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Friday. That followed a revised 2% increase in January, but economists said the two months viewed together represented a solid gain as 2023 got under way. \"February\\'s consumer spending numbers should be viewed as quite strong,\" said Pooja Sriram, U.S. economist at Barclays. \"Households continue to feel the tailwind from strong gains in wages and salaries, fueled by strong labor demand, and continue to dip into excess savings accumulated during the pandemic for additional firepower.\" Inflation continued to take a bite out of spending power, however. When adjusted for rising prices, household spending fell 0.1% in February from the prior month, after rising a revised 1.5% in January. The February figures don\\'t reflect any impact on consumer spending from banking industry turmoil , which emerged in March. Inflation eased in February, though it remains significantly above the Federal Reserve\\'s 2% target. The personal consumption-expenditures price index climbed 5% in February from a year earlier, down from 5.3% in January. The core-PCE price index—which omits volatile food and energy prices—rose 4.6% in February from a year earlier, compared with 4.7% the prior month. The Fed sees the core measure as a better predictor of future inflation. U.S. stocks rose on Friday after the softer inflation and spending figures. The Fed raised short-term interest rates by a quarter-percentage point on March 22, its ninth straight increase aimed at curbing inflation by slowing the economy. It lifted its benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 4.75% and 5%, the highest level since September 2007. Though inflation remains high, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the central bank could stop raising interest rates sooner than previously thought if the recent banking system stress triggers a pullback in lending. In the weeks before the banking crisis, the economy showed surprising strength despite the Fed\\'s rate increases. Employers added a seasonally adjusted 311,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate was 3.6%, near historic lows, the Labor Department said. Home sales rose in February from the prior month for the first time in a year. Early signs indicate that the economy stayed on a solid track in March. S urveys showed that U.S. business activity picked up along with consumer confidence in the economic outlook. Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, are hovering near historically low levels . But banking tumult—and tighter lending that might result—will influence business investments more directly than consumer spending, said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. With consumer spending accounting for around two-thirds of output, a strong labor market translates to a resilient economy, economists said. \"Even though we\\'re seeing layoffs in tech, with unemployment at 3.6%, what you have is that people who want jobs can get jobs,\" said Leo Feler, chief economist at Numerator, a consumer insights and data company. \"That means households have income and spending power.\" Consumers\\' spending accounts for around two-thirds of U.S. economic output, making it the key to growth. Their spending on goods rose 3.7% in February from December, lifted by increased outlays on furniture, electronics and pleasure boats. Spending on services picked up 1.5% in the same period, as consumers shelled out more on air travel and at movie theaters, restaurants and amusement parks. Household finances also got a boost in February, the Commerce report showed. Income rose 0.3% in February from the prior month, pushed up by increasing wages for service sector workers in particular, said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. And the personal saving rate was 4.6% in February, the highest in more than a year. Chandler Atkins, owner of Elms Waterfront Cottages in Lake Luzerne, N.Y., said bookings are as strong as last year with people visiting from across the country. When the economy turns down, New Yorkers tend to dominate bookings as they dial back more ambitious travel plans, he said. But when times are good, those from farther afield pick up. \"I just took a couple bookings yesterday from people in California,\" he said. \"They must feel that the economy is strong enough and they\\'re not facing recession stress right now. Inflation is coming down right now, even though it\\'s happening slowly. It\\'s causing people to feel like things are getting better, not worse, I think.\" Mr. Atkins is expanding his business, launching a new lodging and events venue and an all-terrain vehicle track on Memorial Day. He is keeping an eye on banking industry troubles but isn\\'t overly concerned. \"I don\\'t think that\\'s really going to have an impact on the vacationer this year,\" he said. Solid consumer demand is putting price pressure on services, as consumers shell out on sporting events, concerts, packaged tours, restaurants and other recreation, said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors Inc. \"The price increases for some of these recreation services are just astronomical,\" he said. \"People are slowing their spending overall but basically, companies are able to pass on some more price increases because people are willing to pay.\" Still, higher prices are driving some consumers to seek to cut costs—sometimes in dramatic ways. John Johnson, a 39-year-old mechanical engineer, is fleeing the Washington, D.C. suburbs for Pittsburgh in May in search of a lower cost of living. He and his wife, Elizabeth, had settled in Takoma Park, Md., eight years ago due to its proximity to public transit. But her job is now fully remote, and the neighborhood is relatively pricey. \"Last night we went out and paid $8 for a beer—you can buy a decent bottle of wine for something like that. And even though inflation is 6%, restaurants are 20% or 30% more expensive,\" he said. \"We\\'ve both had pay increases over the past three or four years, but those gains have evened out or even gone negative.\" The couple made plans to renovate their kitchen due to spending more time cooking at home since the pandemic. But they struggled to find contractors and, when they did, couldn\\'t afford the high prices. That is when Mr. Johnson started looking for a job elsewhere. \"The house we\\'re getting in Pittsburgh is pretty much three times bigger than our current house, and only 25% more expensive,\" he said. Write to Gwynn Guilford at gwynn.guilford@wsj.com', 'Markets showed their resilience in the first quarter, despite being rocked by shock waves that few anticipated . Investors began the year feeling largely upbeat. Inflation appeared to be subsiding, and many bet that would lead the Federal Reserve to switch quickly from raising interest rates to cutting them. Then economic data started coming in hot. Stocks and bond prices slid, hit by worries that the Fed would likely have to keep rates higher for longer. The biggest shock of the quarter came in March, when Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. Bank stocks tumbled. Credit Suisse Group AG came to the brink of failure, forcing rival bank UBS Group AG to arrange a hasty takeover. The biggest U.S. banks scrambled to shore up First Republic Bank to stop growing panic from taking down more lenders. In the face of significant uncertainty, markets proved to be more buoyant than many investors thought possible. The S&P 500 rose 7% in the first quarter, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite soared. The technology-heavy index jumped 17%, outperforming the Dow industrials by the widest margin since 2001. Overall, it was Nasdaq\\'s best quarter since the second quarter of 2020. Meanwhile, bond prices climbed . The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which influences everything from mortgage rates to student loans, fell to 3.491% from 3.826% at the end of 2022. That marks its biggest quarterly decline 2020. What explains the relative calm in markets? \"Things have been better than many feared,\" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Asset Management. A widely anticipated recession has failed to materialize, at least so far. The labor market has remained robust, even with a pickup in layoffs in the technology sector in recent months. And inflation, while still high, has continued to ease. Data showed consumer prices rose 6% from a year earlier in February, the smallest annual gain since September 2021. The combination of factors has helped investors including Mr. Freedman to stay somewhat optimistic—although he is still advising clients to stick to higher-quality companies within credit markets. \"We don\\'t think we are out of the woods yet,\" Mr. Freedman said. Some investors and analysts, for instance, are wary of the risk that markets will be proved wrong about where the Fed will take interest rates the rest of the year. Recent projections show Fed officials expect the federal-funds rate to rise to at least 5.1% from its current range of 4.75% to 5%. That suggests the Fed could push through one more quarter-point interest-rate increase and then hold rates at that level for the remainder of the year. Yet Wall Street has once again grown more confident that the Fed will begin cutting rates as soon as the second half. Derivatives markets show traders expect the federal-funds rate to peak at around 4.9% in May, then fall to about 4.4% by the end of the year, according to FactSet. \"There\\'s a disconnect between market expectations for the Fed and what the Fed is saying,\" said Michelle Cluver, portfolio strategist at Global X ETFs, who attributed the bets on rate cuts in part to the fallout from the banking crisis in March. Heightened expectations for rate cuts have driven investors into many of the stocks that were among the worst hit in last year\\'s market selloff. Nvidia Corp. soared 90% in the first quarter, while Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. rose 76% and Tesla Inc. climbed 68%. Bitcoin also jumped. The cryptocurrency traded above $28,000 on Friday, up around 71% for the quarter. Meanwhile, many of last year\\'s biggest winners have lagged behind. Energy stocks , which soared in 2022, fell in the first quarter. So did crude oil prices. Analysts and investors are divided on how long that reversion will last. \"I do believe there may need to be repricing from markets on where rates are going to be,\" Ms. Cluver said. At the moment, with the crisis in the banking sector looking relatively contained, there doesn\\'t seem to be a strong reason for the Fed to cut rates in the near future, she added. For some, the biggest question remains how well the economy will hold up under the strain of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions . \"I don\\'t think anyone can really answer with certainty if we\\'re entirely through a challenging period,\" said Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco. So far, the economy has held up better than many had expected. If there is a recession within the year, it seems likely it would be relatively mild, Mr. Levitt said. \"The challenge is seeing if there\\'s something lurking that makes it more severe,\" he said. Write to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com', 'Coal prices have come crashing down from last year\\'s records. Central Appalachian coal has been trading at $88.80 a short ton, down 57% from the record $205.55 at the start of the year. Cash prices for thermal coal mined from northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin -- two places where a lot of exported coal originates -- have fallen more than half since September, when Europe was stocking up for winter. Futures for coal that is shipped around the Pacific from an Australian export facility have made a similar plunge. Coal markets are highly influenced by those for natural gas, which is also burned to generate electricity. As with coal, natural-gas inventories that looked alarmingly low last summer recovered thanks to unusually warm winter weather that obviated a lot of demand for heating. Natural-gas futures for May delivery ended Thursday at $2.104 per million British thermal unit, down 63% from a year ago. Even after the decline in coal prices, varieties produced in the Eastern U.S. have lately cost between $3.10 to $3.55 per million BTUs, according to the Energy Information Administration. That suggests that coal prices might have to fall further to regain competitiveness with natural gas. Coal also faces increased competition from renewables, including wind, solar, hydropower and biomass, which last year accounted for more U.S. power generation than coal for the first time ever, federal record keepers say. Coal remains expensive relative to prepandemic prices, but its rapid deflation shows that power producers around the world are confident enough in their supplies to stop bidding up cargoes. \"We went from undersupplied to oversupplied very quickly,\" said Andy Blumenfeld, data analytics director at McCloskey by OPIS, a pricing service that is part of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co. Prices started surging in 2021, when producers fired up coal-burning generators to keep air conditioners running during some of the hottest temperatures on record. Stockpiles at U.S. power plants shrank to their lowest since the Nixon administration. A ban on Russian exports following the invasion of Ukraine further crimped supplies, while the highest natural-gas prices in years and the prospect of shortages pushed up what power generators were willing to pay for coal. By the summer of 2022 -- another scorcher -- power producers on both sides of the Atlantic were competing for a limited supply of unsold coal. North American power generators\\' stockpiles dwindled to as little as 58 days\\' worth of coal, nearly a month less than the five-year average, according to energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. Congestion at ports and along rail lines ensnared cargoes, prompting grid operators and utilities to take unusual steps to curtail coal use before the weather turned cold. In Colorado, Xcel Energy Inc.\\'s state subsidiary dialed back how much coal it burned in favor of natural gas, even as the competing fuel\\'s price spiked to shale-era highs. \"Given the fact that we were seeing delays and shortages in the delivery of coal, we made the prudent call that we would use less coal so that we could conserve that in advance of the winter heating season,\" said Robert Kenney, president of Xcel Energy\\'s Colorado arm. Warm winter weather left a lot of coal unburned, though. Between December and January U.S. inventories grew by 4.6% at a time of year when they typically decline, according to EIA data. As they raced to stock up, utilities ordered all the coal they could, much of which is scheduled to be delivered this year and could create a glut, analysts say. For decades coal was the primary fuel burned to generate electricity in the U.S. Since 2010, though, U.S. coal-fired generating capacity has dropped more than 36% amid concerns about emissions and the abundance of gas unleashed by the shale-drilling boom, according to FactSet. Power plant owners are expected to retire an additional 4.5% of coal-fired capacity this year, according to the EIA. As coal-burning capacity has dwindled, so has financing for speculative production. Miners now sell most of their output in advance, with not much more to sell if demand is greater than expected. Big mining companies have told investors that they are mostly sold out for 2023. It is possible that power producers have overbought and will try to resell their coal in export markets or renegotiate deals with their suppliers, which could add downward pressure to prices, McCloskey\\'s Mr. Blumenfeld said. Already, he said, some utilities are burning coal to make space for incoming deliveries even though it has become uneconomical.', 'The Biden administration condemned the detention of a Wall Street Journal reporter in Russia for what Moscow described as espionage, the first such case of an American journalist detained for allegations of spying since the Cold War. The arrest of 31-year-old Evan Gershkovich, a Russian speaker whose parents came to the U.S. from the Soviet Union, marked the latest diplomatic flashpoint between Moscow and Washington. The two countries, already on opposite sides of a war in Ukraine, have also clashed over the arrests of each other\\'s citizens and the state of nuclear-arms treaties. President Biden was briefed on the detention of Mr. Gershkovich, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. She reiterated earlier State Department warnings that Americans are urged to avoid traveling to Russia. \"We\\'ve been very clear about Americans not going to Russia. It is not safe,\" Ms. Jean-Pierre said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. seeks immediate consular access to Mr. Gershkovich so it can provide the appropriate support. \"In the strongest possible terms, we condemn the Kremlin\\'s continued attempts to intimidate, repress, and punish journalists and civil society voices,\" Mr. Blinken said. Russia\\'s main security agency on Thursday said it had detained Mr. Gershkovich in the city of Yekaterinburg, around 800 miles east of Moscow, on Wednesday while he was on a reporting trip, accusing him of espionage. \"The Wall Street Journal vehemently denies the allegations from the FSB and seeks the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter, Evan Gershkovich,\" the Journal said. \"We stand in solidarity with Evan and his family.\" National Security Council Strategic Coordinator John Kirby said it wasn\\'t immediately clear if Mr. Gershkovich\\'s detention was coordinated with Russian leadership, or aimed as retaliation for other grievances. Last week, Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov, 37, a Russian national, was charged in a U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., with acting as an agent of a foreign power, visa fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud and other charges stemming from his alleged illegal activities in the U.S., according to the Justice Department. Russia\\'s Federal Security Bureau said Mr. Gershkovich, \"acting on the instructions of the American side, collected information constituting a state secret about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex.\" Mr. Gershkovich is accredited to work as a journalist in Russia by the country\\'s Foreign Ministry. Authorities took Mr. Gershkovich to Moscow, where he appeared in court with a state-appointed defense attorney and was ordered held in custody until May 29, said the press service of the court, according to state news agency TASS. In Russia, espionage trials are often conducted in secret and it is rare for a court to acquit a defendant. Trials can take months to unfold. \"It\\'s a new low in the U.S.-Russia relationship,\" said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. The arrest of an accredited American reporter \"is really setting a precedent.\" Former Vice President Mike Pence called on the Biden administration to expel Russian diplomats from the U.S. \"It\\'s time for the Biden administration to make it clear with Putin that we\\'re not going to put up with his provocations, we\\'re not going to put up with bullying reporters,\" said Mr. Pence on CNN Thursday. Mr. Pence is considering running for the GOP presidential nomination in 2024. In December, the U.S. released convicted Russian arms-trafficker Viktor Bout in an exchange for U.S. women\\'s basketball star Brittney Griner, whom Russian authorities had detained in the days before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. She was found to be carrying hashish oil in her luggage and was later convicted of drug smuggling and possession. Ms. Griner was sentenced to nine years in a penal colony. The White House and the Kremlin remain entangled over Russia\\'s detention since 2018 of former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan on espionage charges. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, asked about the chance of an exchange for Mr. Gershkovich, said it was premature to discuss the issue. \"I would not even raise the question right now\" because past exchanges involved people already serving sentences, Mr. Ryabkov was quoted by state newswire RIA Novosti as saying on Thursday. \"We\\'ll see how this story develops further.\" Mr. Gershkovich\\'s detention sparked a diplomatic outcry from countries that viewed Russia\\'s actions as unacceptable and a reflection of Russia\\'s systemic indifference to media freedom. Dame Karen Pierce, the British ambassador to Washington, said the incident reflects Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s \"total disregard for basic freedoms.\" Josep Borrell Fontelles, the high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy, said that \"journalists must be allowed to exercise their profession freely and deserve protection.\" Mr. Gershkovich dropped out of contact with his editors while working in Yekaterinburg on Wednesday afternoon. A post later appeared on Telegram describing a man with his face hidden being bundled from a restaurant in the city and put into a waiting van. It couldn\\'t be determined whether the person was Mr. Gershkovich. A lawyer hired by the Journal attempted to find Mr. Gershkovich at the FSB building in Yekaterinburg, but was told authorities had no information about him. Mr. Gershkovich subsequently surfaced in Moscow, where he was represented by a court-appointed lawyer. TASS, which cited unnamed sources, reported that Mr. Gershkovich pleaded not guilty at the closed hearing. His case, according to TASS, is considered top secret. Mr. Gershkovich joined the Journal in January 2022. He has worked as a reporter in Russia since 2017, first for the Moscow Times and then for Agence France-Presse. Earlier, he was a news assistant in New York for the New York Times. A graduate of Bowdoin College, he most recently wrote about the impact of Western sanctions on Russia\\'s economy. Friends and colleagues know him as an enterprising journalist who tackled his new role with energy and courage at a time when covering Mr. Putin\\'s Russia grew more difficult amid a contracting space for freedom of expression and media. \"It was becoming such a frustrating job, and here comes Evan, so full of energy,\" said Nataliya Vasilyeva, a correspondent for Britain\\'s Telegraph who knew Mr. Gershkovich in Moscow. \"It was so amazing to watch him, who didn\\'t have this baggage.\" Mr. Gershkovich was born to a father from Odessa and a mother from St. Petersburg, both Jewish immigrants who settled in the U.S. after leaving the Soviet Union. He mastered the Russian language as an adult living in Moscow, according to friends and colleagues. His understanding of the language and affinity for the Russian people gave him an advantage as a journalist, colleagues said. \"He knew he was American but he also felt very much at home. He traveled around Russia, he felt he was a Moscovite,\" said Ms. Vasilyeva. Reporting in Russia has become much more difficult since Mr. Putin in February last year launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine and then cracked down on domestic dissent. Russia last March passed a censorship law that makes it illegal to publish what authorities deem false information about military operations in Ukraine. In response, many domestic news outlets ceased operations or left the country, and foreign media significantly restricted reporting inside Russia and withdrew many staff. Mr. Putin in October tightened restrictions across Russian society with a presidential decree granting local governments in the country\\'s regions new authority to address security concerns. The measures were aimed at maintaining public order, boosting industrial production in support of the military campaign and protecting critical infrastructure, Mr. Putin said at the time. Media-freedom advocacy groups criticized Mr. Gershkovich\\'s detention, which is the first of a foreign journalist since Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine last year, according to Reporters Without Borders. The France-based group is \"alarmed by what looks like retaliation against journalists,\" said spokeswoman Pauline Ades-Mevel. \"Journalists must not be targeted, even if unfortunately they have been regularly since the invasion.\" Mr. Gershkovich is the first U.S. journalist detained on espionage charges in Russia that the Committee to Protect Journalists has documented since the 1986 detention of Nicholas Daniloff. \"CPJ is deeply concerned by the arrest of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. This is the latest in a long line of attempts by Russia to use national security laws to silence reporting. We urge his immediate release,\" said CPJ President Jodie Ginsberg. According to CPJ, 363 journalists were imprisoned around the world as of December, including 199 held on allegations of \"antistate\" activities. Wall Street Journal reporters have been detained in other countries, but rarely, if ever, formally arrested. Reporter Dion Nissenbaum in 2016 was detained in Istanbul for more than two days over a social-media post and then released by Turkish authorities without being charged. In China, over recent decades many Journal reporters have been detained for brief periods, and, in 2020, almost all Journal reporters were expelled. In 1987, Cairo-based reporter Gerald Seib was detained for several days in Iran after being invited by the government and accused of being a Zionist spy traveling on a fake passport. Iranian officials later said his detention resulted from a misunderstanding. Mr. Gershkovich since joining the Journal has covered a variety of Russia-related topics, including the recent visit by Chinese leader Xi Jinping to Moscow, close associates of Mr. Putin and tensions between Kremlin officials and Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of Russian paramilitary group Wagner. After initially withdrawing their correspondents from the country early in the war, some news organizations have restored their Russia-based reporters, and the Russian Foreign Ministry has continued to extend accreditation to some foreign journalists. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday said \"those who carry out normal journalistic activities, of course, if they have valid accreditation, they will continue to work.\" --- Sam Schechner, Sabrina Siddiqui, Georgi Kantchev and Eliza Collins contributed to this article.', 'Before the NCAA women\\'s basketball tournament began, oddsmakers said South Carolina had a 73.3% chance of winning. Not winning its first game or two, but the whole thing, meaning six in a row including the championship. Anyone who\\'s scratched out a bracket for the 68-team men\\'s or women\\'s tournaments -- only to see it turn to garden mulch by Day 3 -- knows that odds like those aren\\'t just rare. They\\'re downright preposterous. And yet here are the No. 1 seeded Gamecocks, headed to their third consecutive Final Four and what they hope will be their second consecutive national title. On Friday they\\'ll face sharpshooting Caitlin Clark and No. 2 seed Iowa in a matchup that\\'s the hottest ticket on record: On Wednesday, tickets for the semifinals in Dallas were reselling for $272, the highest average for a Women\\'s Final Four entry since ticket marketplace Vivid Seats started tracking data in 2010. Although South Carolina has its share of stars -- most notably 2022 national player of the year Aliyah Boston -- Coach Dawn Staley\\'s squad is more remarkable for its colossal sturdiness. The Gamecocks are on a 42-game winning streak dating to last season. They\\'re balanced on both ends of the floor, the nation\\'s top team in rebounding and blocked shots. But where South Carolina really crushes souls is in the waves of reinforcements it can send at opponents, like lines of fresh players in hockey. The Gamecocks\\' bench scores 36 points per game, or nearly 45% of the team\\'s offense. Staley can go with almost any lineup, at almost any time, and know South Carolina can win. \"The simple fact is, we have great players in the starting lineup but we also have great players on the bench,\" said Fred Chmiel, a South Carolina assistant coach. \"So [Staley] doesn\\'t hesitate to sub somebody in if someone looks fatigued or they\\'re not on their best game, or they\\'re hobbled a little bit. She has no pause in just subbing in somebody and letting them play.\" Through the regular season, South Carolina starters played a combined 105 minutes a game, the fewest among the nation\\'s top 25 teams. By comparison, Iowa\\'s starters played 145 minutes. The two other Final Four teams\\' starters also played considerably more than South Carolina\\'s starters: LSU\\'s played 140 minutes, and Virginia Tech\\'s played 160 minutes. Even the Gamecocks\\' star, Boston, spent 15 of every 40 minutes a game on the bench during the regular season. Although Boston\\'s stats were better last year, when she averaged a double-double, Staley said in a news conference Tuesday, \"I think this year is the best year of her career because she\\'s able to pivot, she\\'s able to give us what we need when we need it.\" South Carolina has found its stars are willing to defer to the common good: winning its third national title in seven years. Even in an age of liberal NCAA transfer rules, the Gamecocks have had a total of just four players transfer out before finishing their undergraduate eligibility over the past five seasons, according to a team official. South Carolina\\'s core -- Boston, Zia Cooke, Brea Beal and Victaria Saxton -- has stuck around for four years. South Carolina\\'s runaway victories have given it the benefit of resting its starters. The Gamecocks are winning by an average of nearly 30 points a game. But having such a deep roster, and playing so many players double-digit minutes a game, is also a strategy. \"We have a suffocating style of defense,\" Chmiel said. \"There\\'s always a high amount of energy, intensity within that 40 minutes. It would be extremely hard for a player to play 40 minutes for us.\" Laeticia Amihere is a perfect example of the player buy-in South Carolina has achieved. The 6-foot-4 senior forward from Mississauga, Ontario, was a top-10 player out of high school. She played for Canada in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. She\\'s a projected pick in the upcoming WNBA Draft. At South Carolina she comes off the bench, averaging 7.1 points and 3.3 rebounds in 15 minutes a game. \"I just want to make it to the next level. So whatever I have to do to do that, I\\'m happy,\" Amihere said.', 'WASHINGTON -- The House voted 225 to 204 to pass Republicans\\' wide-ranging energy agenda, a collection of proposals designed to boost oil and gas production and accelerate new projects while striking a contrast with the Biden administration\\'s emphasis on shifting to greener sources. The bill represents Republicans\\' opening wish list as members of both parties seek a way forward on energy policy, amid concerns over high prices, climate change and overseas threats. The GOP legislation is designed to boost oil and gas output, increase mining of critical minerals in the U.S. and revamp the National Environmental Policy Act permitting process to streamline reviews for coming projects. The bill is \"focused on lowering energy costs for families that have been out of control and putting in sound, responsible policies that actually allow us to produce energy in America,\" said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R., La.). The bill, dubbed the \"Lower Energy Costs Act\" has been given the H.R. 1 moniker by House Republicans, signifying it as a priority this Congress. The legislation has little chance of becoming law, but some elements could be part of talks with Democrats later this year, and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) has floated changes to energy policy as a condition for agreeing to raise the nation\\'s debt ceiling. President Biden has taken some executive actions to limit the use of fossil fuels and make it easier for renewable energy to be expanded. Democratic leaders are opposed to the House bill, which they have dubbed the \"polluters over people\" act, a dig at GOP efforts to help fossil-fuel companies. The bill isn\\'t expected to get a vote in the Senate, where Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has called it dead on arrival. Mr. Biden this week said he would veto the bill if it came to his desk. \"Many Democrats and Republicans understand that we need a bipartisan, bicameral approach to produce a serious energy package,\" said Mr. Schumer. Four Democrats voted for the GOP-led proposal: Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas as well as Jared Golden of Maine and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington. One Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, voted against the measure. Mr. Gonzalez said the permitting aspect of the bill is important for Democratic policies to move forward. --- Yuka Hayashi contributed to this article.', 'The Biden administration condemned the detention of a Wall Street Journal reporter in Russia for what Moscow described as espionage, the first such case of an American journalist detained for allegations of spying since the Cold War.

Parked squarely over the line is the 2022 GMC Hummer EV Edition 1, General Motors' all-electric off-road truck. Whatever mean tweet you could compose about GM's colossal electric sport-utility truck (SUT), I'm here for it. This 9,063-pound, 1,000-hp, six-figure spectacle of modern automaking comes equipped with everything but a sense of decency. And yet I caution against snap judgments and easy dismissals. The Hummer truck might be dumb as a hammer, but as hammers go, it's pretty ingenious. These things are still rare. Deliveries began in December 2021 but production at GM's new Factory Zero was paused in November, with a reported 5,000 produced. In the meantime GM has teed up production of the Hummer EV SUV as well as the GMC Sierra Denali EV pickup, all using the new BT1 electric skateboard and modular Ultium battery pack. I finally managed to rent an Edition 1 last week, in Florida, at the height of spring break, which might not have been my first choice. When I got to Daytona Beach, with the intention of driving on the famous strand, the streets were near-'bout roaring with young wastrels in hot cars and hitched-up pickups, or else rapping their rage-addled motorbikes from light to light. None of these delightful people seemed like they were going to sleep anytime soon. Lucky me. I had stumbled upon the Hummer's aspirational sensibility. Among these sunburned ballers and players-in-waiting, America's future super-consumers, the truck arrived like an absolute A-list star. Wow. The kids went bonkers. The mayor of Daytona Beach might as well have given me the keycard to the city. After two days in the eye of this Instagrammed hurricane—and a couple of easy stoplight victories over the fast and the curious—I started wanting to believe in GM's strategic vision for the Hummer brand, which means to advance vehicle electrification through the power of male idiocy. Consider the name, reviving a brand that embodied the most knavish sensibilities of American auto culture in the 2000s. Or observe its Soviet-style proportions: 18 feet long, 86.7 inches wide with the mirrors folded and 79.1 inches tall—with adjustable pneumatic suspension able to lift the belly of the beast another 5.8 inches, to a maximum 15.9 inches. The truck's arrival at a hotel valet stand is a daunting, prodigious moment. Guests start looking around for virgins to sacrifice. Sure, if strict reason ruled, GM's first proper electric pickup would have been smooth-skinned and aerodynamically efficient. Instead, it looks kickass and amazing! Coldly technical, chiseled and chamfered, with a mouthful of skid plate and 35-inch mudders that churn in cavernous wheel wells like machinery you don't want to fall into. Naturally, given its Borg-cube shape, the drag factors are high and, consequently, energy consumption goes from bad to terrible the faster you go. The estimated range is 329 miles. The renter reported he had gone over 400 miles by keeping below 55 mph. But at a Florida-friendly 80 mph, the real-world range looked more like 270 miles. The wind noise is so high you can barely hear the hip-hop blasting from the next vehicle. Ideally, it would be easier to see out of. As it is, the truck's high sills and squinting greenhouse create a veritable panopticon of blind spots. For that reason it is, and must be, bristling with cameras, 9 in total. Small price to pay for looking so dope. As a preview of future solutions from GM, there is lots to love. The sober and sophisticated cabin design, the material choices, the spare but modern switchgear, the smart and snappy graphical environment—the interior gets four stars. Fit and finish was excellent. Compared with the underbaked Rivian R1T I tested , the Hummer looked like it was assembled in a NASA clean room. Among the more beguiling features: four huge removable roof panels of blue-tinted glass. It's like a bro terrarium. It's certainly athletic for earth-moving equipment. Three electric motors, one between the front wheels and two between the rear, direct a combined maximum of 1,000 hp and 1,200 pound-feet to the ground. With the launch-assist engaged the truck can huck itself to 60 mph in as little as 3 seconds, according to GM. And thus something the weight of a well-equipped ambulance will accelerate like a top-line Porsche 911. Progress! I was never so premeditated. Whenever I needed to overtake, I just willed it so. Within the space of a couple inches of pedal travel, the Hummer EV will squat luridly then seem to fire itself out of its own superconducting railgun. The famous beach was closed for traffic but I found some well-groomed acreage in an out-of-the-way construction zone in which to disport. Before wading into the soft, foot-deep sand, I engaged Terrain mode, which fully liberates the rear steering system, allowing a sharper steering angle. This is the mischief mode: All you need to do is crank the wheel hard and floor it, and the truck will augur itself into a tidy circular hole in the ground. In many ways I found the Hummer truck strangely impervious to criticism. The biggest knock is its alarming 4.5-ton curb weight, nearly a third of which is battery. That is definitely not optimum. Due to the pack's mass, the truck's payload capacity is that of a midsize truck and the braking distances are like that of small civilian aircraft. It took Car and Driver 504 feet to whoa one of these down from 100 mph. But better, lighter, more compact, more energy-dense batteries are coming. Everything else about the Hummer is ready and waiting, and kind of terrific. In the meantime, stay off wooden bridges. 2022 GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 Pickup Price: $110,295 Powertrain: Fully electric, with three AC synchronous motors (one in front, two in the rear), direct drive, 205 kWh kWh liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery pack, 800V system, 11.5-kW onboard charger Power/torque: 1,000 hp/1,200 pound-feet maximum combined Length/wheelbase/width/height: 216.8/135.6/86.7/79.1 inches Curb weight: 9,063 pounds 0-60 mph: 3 seconds EPA-estimated range: 329 miles Charging: 11 kW onboard charger; DC fast charger, 20-80% in 42 mins Cargo capacity: 11.3/36.7 cubic feet, front trunk/cargo bed more in rumble seat\", 'WASHINGTON—The House on Thursday voted 225 to 204 to pass Republicans\\' wide-ranging energy agenda, a collection of proposals designed to boost oil and gas production and accelerate new projects while striking a contrast with the Biden administration\\'s emphasis on shifting to greener sources .

President Biden, who calls climate change an emergency, has taken some executive actions to limit the use of fossil fuels and make it easier for renewable energy to be expanded. Last year, he signed into law sweeping legislation that boosted the renewable-energy sector . Democratic leaders are opposed to the House bill, which they have dubbed the \"polluters over people\" act, a dig at GOP efforts to help fossil-fuel companies. The bill isn\\'t expected to get a vote in the Senate, where Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has called it dead on arrival. Mr. Biden this week said he would veto the bill if it came to his desk. \"Many Democrats and Republicans understand that we need a bipartisan, bicameral approach to produce a serious energy package,\" said Mr. Schumer. \"Our side will continue working in good faith on real permitting reform talks.\" Four Democrats voted for the GOP-led proposal: Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas as well as Jared Golden of Maine and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington. One Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, voted against the measure. Mr. Gonzalez said the permitting aspect of the bill is important for Democratic policies to move forward. The bill seeks to change the process of how utility-scale energy projects such as power-transmission lines and offshore wind farms are approved. Typically, the projects have to win approval from authorities in several jurisdictions , which can take years. \"While this package is far from perfect, it is a step forward,\" he said. Other Democrats have embraced permitting as a priority. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) helped push through Mr. Biden\\'s climate policy bill last year, but a companion bill he supported to speed up the permitting process stalled. While airing his frustration over that, he has also lashed out at the administration over what he says is improper implementation of the 2022 law, dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act. He is concerned that the administrations\\' interpretation of the legislation is moving the IRA away from its original intent of boosting domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains for critical minerals needed to produce electric vehicles and other products. Administration officials are \"ignoring the law\\'s intent to support and expand fossil energy and are redefining \\'domestic energy\\' to increase clean-energy spending to potentially deficit-breaking levels,\" he wrote in an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday . Mr. Manchin\\'s article was published just as the Treasury Department is set to release new rules on the sourcing of battery contents and minerals for the IRA\\'s electric-vehicle tax-credit program. \"We\\'ll see how it works out,\" Mr. Manchin said this week when asked about the GOP energy bill. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the White House will continue to work with Mr. Manchin on \"shared priorities and values\" including reducing the deficit and pursuing permitting changes. Some House Republicans have signaled a willingness to separate the legislation into parts, to see if more senators may jump on board to passing portions of the bill, such as permitting changes. \"If you can\\'t get [a project] in the ground, you can\\'t deploy those electrons on the grid from an offshore wind farm the same way as you can\\'t deploy those electrons from a coal plant in North Dakota,\" said Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R., N.D.). GOP leadership opened the legislation up to several amendments, allowing for lawmakers to amend the bill in floor votes. Several were adopted, including one by freshman Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R., Fla.) that requires the government to study the impact of wind energy on military readiness, the marine environment and tourism, before the secretary of the Interior Department can pursue development off the coast of Florida. Republicans argue that Mr. Biden\\'s policies have hampered the production of fossil fuels and driven up energy prices as a result. They say that the Biden administration shouldn\\'t look around the world to import oil and precious minerals, but instead boost production in the U.S. The Biden administration has leased fewer acres for oil-and-gas drilling offshore and on federal land in the first two years of his administration than any of his predecessors during a comparable time frame dating back to the end of World War II, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. The administration has pushed oil and fracking companies to use the permits they do have, while some companies have held off , not wanting to run out of prime locations. Some oil executives concede that investor pressure, inflation and labor and equipment shortages have done more to curtail oil production than Mr. Biden\\'s climate policies. Republicans have pointed to the Biden administration this year blocking mining upstream of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area of Northern Minnesota for 20 years, opting to protect a pristine wilderness over allowing production of minerals that could help produce clean-energy projects. The administration last year also canceled two federal mineral rights leases held by Twin Metals Minnesota LLC, a unit of Chilean mining firm Antofagasta Minerals SA. The latest move could kill the company\\'s planned underground copper-nickel mine, although Twin Metals said it would continue to fight the cancellation. The Biden administration earlier this month approved a massive Willow oil-drilling project in Alaska , over the objections of environmentalists and many Democrats. The administration also announced a plan to block future oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Ocean\\'s federal waters and issue new federal rules limiting oil and gas leasing on 13 million acres of Alaska\\'s National Petroleum Reserve.

Not winning its first game or two, but the whole thing, meaning six in a row including the championship. Anyone who\\'s scratched out a bracket for the 68-team men\\'s or women\\'s tournaments—only to see it turn to garden mulch by Day 3—knows that odds like those aren\\'t just rare. They\\'re downright preposterous. And yet here are the No. 1 seeded Gamecocks, headed to their third consecutive Final Four and what they hope will be their second consecutive national title. On Friday they\\'ll face sharpshooting Caitlin Clark and No. 2 seed Iowa in a matchup that\\'s the hottest ticket on record: On Wednesday, tickets for the semifinals in Dallas were reselling for $272, the highest average for a Women\\'s Final Four entry since ticket marketplace Vivid Seats started tracking data in 2010. Although South Carolina has its share of stars—most notably 2022 national player of the year Aliyah Boston—Coach Dawn Staley\\'s squad is more remarkable for its colossal sturdiness. The Gamecocks are on a 42-game winning streak dating to last season. They\\'re balanced on both ends of the floor, the nation\\'s top team in rebounding and blocked shots. But where South Carolina really crushes souls is in the waves of reinforcements it can send at opponents, like lines of fresh players in hockey. The Gamecocks\\' bench scores 36 points per game, or nearly 45% of the team\\'s offense. Staley can go with almost any lineup, at almost any time, and know South Carolina can win. \"The simple fact is, we have great players in the starting lineup but we also have great players on the bench,\" said Fred Chmiel, a South Carolina assistant coach. \"So [Staley] doesn\\'t hesitate to sub somebody in if someone looks fatigued or they\\'re not on their best game, or they\\'re hobbled a little bit. She has no pause in just subbing in somebody and letting them play.\" Through the regular season, South Carolina starters played a combined 105 minutes a game, the fewest among the nation\\'s top 25 teams. By comparison, Iowa\\'s starters played 145 minutes. The two other Final Four teams\\' starters also played considerably more than South Carolina\\'s starters: LSU\\'s played 140 minutes, and Virginia Tech\\'s played 160 minutes. Even the Gamecocks\\' star, Boston, spent 15 of every 40 minutes a game on the bench during the regular season. Although Boston\\'s stats were better last year, when she averaged a double-double, Staley said in a press conference Tuesday, \"I think this year is the best year of her career because she\\'s able to pivot, she\\'s able to give us what we need when we need it.\" South Carolina has found its stars are willing to defer to the common good: winning its third national title in seven years. Even in an age of liberal NCAA transfer rules, the Gamecocks have had a total of just four players transfer out before finishing their undergraduate eligibility over the past five seasons, according to a team official. South Carolina\\'s core—Boston, Zia Cooke, Brea Beal and Victaria Saxton—has stuck around for four years. Certainly, South Carolina\\'s runaway victories have given it the benefit of resting its starters. The Gamecocks are winning by an average of nearly 30 points a game. But having such a deep roster, and playing so many players double-digit minutes a game, is also a strategy. \"We have a suffocating style of defense,\" Chmiel said. \"And then offensively, we push to score on makes and misses. So we\\'re always running the floor. There\\'s always a high amount of energy, intensity within that 40 minutes. It would be extremely hard for a player to play 40 minutes for us.\" Chmiel acknowledged that competing programs use South Carolina\\'s depth against it in recruiting, telling top players won\\'t see the court much there. He counters that by pointing to Boston\\'s playing time—and her achievements. \"She\\'s still All-American,\" he said. \"She\\'s still been player of the year, defensive player of the year, all-conference. She plays 25 minutes. That allows somebody else to get 15 minutes on the average. So if you\\'re a freshman coming in, you know you\\'re not going to sit there and watch an entire game, that there\\'s 15 minutes available to play.\" Laeticia Amihere is a perfect example of the player buy-in South Carolina has achieved. The 6-foot-4 senior forward from Mississauga, Ontario, was a top-10 player out of high school. She played for Canada in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. She\\'s a projected pick in the upcoming WNBA Draft. At South Carolina she comes off the bench, averaging 7.1 points and 3.3 rebounds in 15 minutes a game. \"I think we\\'ve just been kind of lucky in that way where we\\'re able to push a lead and we\\'re able to play, like, our third string and still be able to excel,\" Amihere said. \"Obviously I just want to make it to the next level. So whatever I have to do to do that, I\\'m happy.\" There, again, South Carolina turns less playing time into a selling point. \"AAU basketball goes the majority of the year before they get here,\" Chmiel said. \"They get no breaks. It goes right into scholastic basketball. They get no breaks. So I mean, they\\'re playing four straight years and then they\\'re going to come here and log 32 games, so 120 more games. That\\'s a lot of minutes.\" If seniors are good enough, they\\'ll go directly into the WNBA season, then probably play for an overseas team in the offseason. \"So we embrace the fact that we can sit them down and rest them,\" Chmiel said. That luxury has given South Carolina another advantage: one of the best-rested teams at the Final Four. Write to Rachel Bachman at Rachel.Bachman@wsj.com', 'Coal prices have come crashing down from last year\\'s records. Central Appalachian coal has been trading at $88.80 a short ton, down 57% from the record $205.55 at the start of the year. Cash prices for thermal coal mined from northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin—two places where a lot of exported coal originates—have fallen more than half since September, when Europe was stocking up for winter . Futures for coal that is shipped around the Pacific from an Australian export facility have made a similar plunge. Coal markets are highly influenced by those for natural gas , which is also burned to generate electricity. As with coal, natural-gas inventories that looked alarmingly low last summer recovered thanks to unusually warm winter weather that obviated a lot of demand for heating. Natural-gas futures for May delivery ended Thursday at $2.104 per million British thermal unit, down 63% from a year ago. Even after the decline in coal prices, varieties produced in the eastern U.S. have lately cost between $3.10 to $3.55 per million BTUs, according to the Energy Information Administration. That suggests that coal prices might have to fall further to regain competitiveness with natural gas. Coal also faces increased competition from renewables , including wind, solar, hydropower and biomass, which last year accounted for more U.S. power generation than coal for the first time ever , federal record-keepers say. Coal remains expensive relative to prepandemic prices, but its rapid deflation shows that power producers around the world are confident enough in their supplies to stop bidding up cargoes. \"We went from undersupplied to oversupplied very quickly,\" said Andy Blumenfeld, data analytics director at McCloskey by OPIS, a pricing service that is part of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co. Prices started surging in 2021, when power producers fired up coal-burning generators to keep air conditioners running during some of the hottest temperatures on record. Stockpiles at U.S. power plants shrank to their lowest level since the Nixon administration . A ban on Russian exports following the invasion of Ukraine further crimped supplies while the highest natural-gas prices in years and the prospect of shortages pushed up what power generators were willing to pay for coal. By the summer of 2022— another scorcher —power producers on both sides of the Atlantic were competing for a limited supply of unsold coal. North American power generators\\' stockpiles dwindled to as little as 58 days\\' worth of coal, nearly a month less than the five-year average, according to energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. Congestion at ports and along rail lines ensnared cargoes, prompting grid operators and utilities to take unusual steps to curtail coal use before the weather turned cold. In Colorado, Xcel Energy Inc.\\'s state subsidiary dialed back how much coal it burned in favor of natural gas, even as the competing fuel\\'s price spiked to shale-era highs. \"Given the fact that we were seeing delays and shortages in the delivery of coal, we made the prudent call that we would use less coal so that we could conserve that in advance of the winter heating season,\" said Robert Kenney, president of Xcel Energy\\'s Colorado arm. Warm winter weather left a lot of coal unburned, though. Between December and January U.S. inventories grew by 4.6% at a time of year when they typically decline, according to EIA data. As they raced to stock up, utilities ordered all the coal they could, much of which is scheduled to be delivered this year and could create a glut, analysts say. For decades coal was the primary fuel burned to generate electricity in the U.S. Since 2010, though, U.S. coal-fired generating capacity has dropped more than 36% amid concerns about emissions and the abundance of gas unleashed by the shale-drilling boom , according to FactSet. Power plant owners are expected to retire another 4.5% of coal-fired capacity this year, according to the EIA. As coal-burning capacity has dwindled, so has financing for speculative production. Miners now sell most of their output in advance, with not much more to sell if demand is greater than expected. Big mining companies have told investors that they are mostly sold out for 2023. It is possible that power producers have overbought and will try to resell their coal in export markets or renegotiate deals with their suppliers, which could add downward pressure to prices, McCloskey\\'s Mr. Blumenfeld said. Already, he said, some utilities are burning coal to make space for incoming deliveries even though it has become uneconomical.

House Republicans\\' response: not going to happen. The chairman of the House Budget Committee, Texas Rep. Jodey Arrington, said in an interview that the GOP budget process could take months to play out, pushing it past the deadline for Congress to act on raising the debt ceiling and avoid a U.S. default on debt payments and other government obligations. Instead, he and other top Republicans want to start talks immediately on a shorter list of demands for this year, without a formal budget in hand. \"The more urgent matter is to address the debt ceiling and negotiate spending limitations and broader fiscal reforms in the process,\" Mr. Arrington said. On when Republicans could produce a budget, the Texas lawmaker said he would be disappointed if the House didn\\'t pass a budget resolution before the end of the fiscal year in September. GOP lawmakers want spending reductions and policy changes as a condition for raising the debt limit. Mr. Biden has said the debt ceiling should be raised with no conditions attached, while saying he is open to a separate debate over fiscal policy once Republicans produce a budget. The Treasury Department ran up against the roughly $31.4 trillion debt limit in January. It is now deploying special accounting maneuvers to keep paying the government\\'s obligations. The U.S. could become unable to pay all of its bills as soon as this summer. Mr. Arrington pointed to a list of priorities presented by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) as the opening bid for Republicans in their negotiations with the White House. The list, referenced in a letter Mr. McCarthy sent Tuesday to Mr. Biden, includes rolling back top-line spending to fiscal 2022 levels and locking in small annual increases from there, as well as clawing back unspent Covid-19 funds, strengthening work requirements for government programs and making changes to energy policy. In his letter, Mr. McCarthy said that talks should begin immediately. The White House released its own budget proposal earlier this month, which includes tax increases designed to narrow the budget deficit. Mr. Biden said Tuesday that he wanted to see Mr. McCarthy\\'s budget plan before Easter recess -- which starts Friday -- before beginning talks. While neither budget would have a chance of becoming law, they serve to outline the parties\\' policy intentions. Under the law, Congress is supposed to release a budget resolution in April, though lawmakers from both parties have failed to meet that deadline in recent years. Mr. McCarthy had previously said the GOP budget would be delayed a short time because the president\\'s own budget was late. Republicans have set a goal of balancing the budget over 10 years while extending expiring tax cuts, an effort that would require deep reductions across the government, particularly if Social Security, Medicare and defense are off the table, as lawmakers have indicated. Mr. Arrington said the broader overhaul of federal taxes and spending would have to wait until later this year, because of its complexities as well as the need to build GOP consensus in the closely divided House. Delaying a fuller budget, he said, would also put off anticipated political attacks that could derail talks over the debt ceiling with Mr. Biden. He said he didn\\'t plan to address the solvency of Social Security and Medicare in his budget, saying instead that entitlement spending should be tackled in a bipartisan manner through separate discussions. The White House has said that the GOP budget effort would lay out severe cuts to federal spending, making the proposal politically radioactive for many Republican lawmakers facing re-election next year. \"Every week, House Republicans invent a new excuse to hide their budget from the American people even while signaling that they would impose devastating cuts,\" said White House spokesman Andrew Bates. --- Lindsay Wise contributed to this article.', 'The Biden administration is pushing hard for American businesses to invest in Africa despite the obstacles they face there, more than a decade after China began expanding its economic and political ties with countries across the continent. Vice President Kamala Harris pledged on Tuesday in Ghana\\'s seaside capital to double down on efforts to bring billions of dollars in investments to Africa, a continent many Western investors still view as high risk. Ms. Harris is the highest ranking in a string of top White House and Biden administration officials to travel through Africa this year, promising to unlock American investment as the U.S. and China look to tap into the continent\\'s vast natural resources. But U.S. and other Western investors often cite corruption, poor infrastructure and still-rampant poverty, all of which preclude easily operating across dozens of countries that all have their own rules and market peculiarities. U.S. interest in expanding influence on the continent comes as tensions and competition with China are rising. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, Chinese companies have spent over a decade and billions of dollars buying out U.S. and European miners in the country\\'s cobalt and copper belt. Experts say the U.S. has a lot of ground to make up, especially in areas of strategic importance, like securing supply chains for materials such as battery metals, critical for the energy transition. \"The Chinese system is a lot more centralized, and state power plays a much larger role,\" said Cobus van Staden, Johannesburg-based managing editor of the China-Global South Project, formerly known as the China Africa Project, a nonprofit. \"The Chinese view on Africa has been very opportunity focused. There is this very strong focus on risk in the U.S. private sector, to the exclusion of all of the opportunities.\" The U.S. financed roughly $14 billion of projects on the continent from 2007 to 2020, while comparable Chinese institutions financed about $120 billion over the period, according to an analysis by Oyintarelado Moses, a data analyst with the Global China Initiative at Boston University\\'s Global Development Policy Center, using data from the U.S. government and the Chinese Loans to Africa Database. Ms. Harris\\'s trip follows visits to Africa by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield this year, but U.S. officials still face institutional hurdles to counter Chinese economic dominance on the continent. \"In terms of perception, I think [the U.S. is] doing everything right,\" said Gyude Moore, senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development and Liberia\\'s former Minister of Public Works. The stumbling blocks that remain include a lack of available infrastructure financing from the U.S., easier access to higher education in China for Africans versus the U.S., and concerns that this U.S. push into Africa might be episodic, he said. On Wednesday, Ms. Harris announced about $1 billion of new programs and investments aimed at empowering African businesswomen -- much of it from foundations.', 'DUBAI -- Saudi Arabia is strengthening its commercial and security ties with China, as U.S. influence wanes in the Middle East. The Saudi government approved partial membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a political and security bloc that includes China, Russia and India, the Saudi state news agency reported Wednesday. The decision comes ahead of a May meeting of foreign ministers from the regional grouping, where Iran recently gained full member status. The move is part of a broad effort in Saudi Arabia and some neighboring Persian Gulf countries to expand diplomatic partnerships beyond traditional Western allies in a marked pivot to the east, analysts say. It comes amid uncertainty about Washington\\'s long-term commitment to ensure security in the strategic, energy-rich region, where the U.S. has been a dominant force for decades but is increasingly focused on a rising China and a belligerent Russia. In a sign of the geopolitical realignment under way, Saudi Arabia re-established diplomatic relations with rival Iran this month in a deal brokered by China that burnished Beijing\\'s credentials as a new power broker in the region. The Saudi kingdom also is nearing a deal to restore ties with Syria following negotiations mediated by Russia. The SCO historically has had a heavy focus on regional security cooperation, and accelerated Saudi interactions with China and Russia there risk backlash from the U.S., which is wary of its traditional security partners in the region cozying up to its global rivals. \"By engaging with these U.S. rivals, it really does seem like this multipolarity is in full-bore here now,\" said Jonathan Fulton, an expert on China-Middle East relations and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. \"We\\'re seeing what a less U.S.-centered Gulf or Middle East looks like.\" Analysts say China isn\\'t trying to replace the broad American role in the Middle East, where the U.S.\\'s continued military presence is unrivaled, but could chip away at its supremacy in the region. Saudi Arabia and China are building on ties that, until now, were firmly rooted in energy and trade, as Beijing\\'s oil imports swelled in the past three decades in line with its expanding economy. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\\'s de facto ruler, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Tuesday, reaffirming their strategic relationship which Mr. Xi said was in \"the best shape of all time,\" Chinese state media said. China is Saudi Arabia\\'s top trading partner. Besides oil, business has expanded to include large contracts for Chinese construction companies, widespread adoption of Chinese technology despite security concerns and the transfer of military hardware. China is also helping the Saudis fabricate uranium yellowcake, which is needed for a nuclear-energy program or nuclear-arms capability. Earlier this week, the two countries signed major deals that saw state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco take a $3.6 billion stake in Rongsheng Petrochemical Co. Ltd. to expand its downstream presence in China and join with Norinco Group and Panjin Xincheng Industrial Group to construct an integrated refinery and petrochemical complex in northeast China. The refinery and petrochemical complex is expected to produce 300,000 barrels a day at a cost of 83.7 billion yuan, or $12.2 billion.

He said he didn\\'t plan to address the solvency of Social Security and Medicare in his budget, saying instead that entitlement spending should be tackled in a bipartisan manner through separate discussions. As much as 92% of projected nominal spending growth is driven by Social Security, federal healthcare programs and interest payments on the national debt, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Trustees for the Social Security Trust Funds projected last year that the program\\'s combined reserves would be depleted in 2035 . Once Social Security\\'s reserves run out, revenue would pay for roughly 80% of scheduled benefits, unless Congress steps in.

A recent Congressional Budget Office analysis showed how difficult balancing the budget will be. Under a scenario in which Medicare and Social Security as well as military and veterans spending are protected, and expiring tax cuts are extended, even eliminating 100% of all other noninterest federal spending would still result in a small deficit. Mr. Arrington said that the eventual GOP proposal would make significant progress in closing the deficit but might not hit the goal of balancing the budget in a decade, based on trade-offs needed to get enough GOP votes to pass the package. He compared the effort to herding butterflies, calling his colleagues \"lively, colorful and unwieldy.\" On balancing the budget, he said, \"whether it\\'s 10 years, whether it\\'s 10 or 12, or 15…you will know the direction and the policies that drive our directional difference between the president and our Republican budget,\" he said.

The British government has deployed the new king in a soft-power play that aims to reinforce cultural bonds between the two nations and point to how they can work more closely together on issues such as climate change and foreign policy, British officials said. The king was also due to visit France last week, but that trip was abandoned at the behest of the French government amid mass protests in the country over a pension overhaul. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who unlike his French and U.S. counterparts holds a largely ceremonial role, welcomed King Charles and Camilla, the queen consort, at the historic Brandenburg Gate on Wednesday with military honors. He is set to host a state banquet for the monarch in the evening. Buckingham Palace said it was the first time that a head of state was welcomed at the gate. U.S. President Ronald Reagan held a speech with the gate in the background in 1987, but this was before Germany\\'s reunification, when the triumphal arch stood on the East side of the Berlin Wall. \"Today, on the day six years ago when Britain began its exit from the European Union, we are opening a new chapter,\" Mr. Steinmeier said in a speech later Wednesday. He said that the king\\'s choice to visit Germany for his inaugural foreign trip as monarch was a \"great personal gesture and I think at the same time an important sign for German-British relations.\" Earlier, the monarch and the queen consort posted on Twitter about their \"great joy to be able to continue the deepening of the longstanding friendship between our two nations.\" On Thursday, the monarch is set to give a speech at Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, which he addressed in 2020 as the then-prince of Wales. He will also meet Chancellor Olaf Scholz, talk to Ukrainian refugees and meet with British and German soldiers. In recent months, Britain has sought to refresh ties with its European neighbors after years of acrimony following its split from the European Union. Most recently, the U.K. announced a compromise deal with the EU to end a long-running argument over trading arrangements with Northern Ireland. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak visited Paris earlier this month to heap praise on French President Emmanuel Macron . The king\\'s tour to France and Germany was set to seal this rapprochement. Buckingham Palace says that the trip not only serves to reinforce relations but also to point to how the two nations can work together to tackle climate change, support Ukraine in its war with Russia and improve trading relations, which have been damaged by Brexit. King Charles, who is of German descent, is no stranger to Germany. In his previous role as Prince of Wales, he undertook 29 visits to the country. The royal couple will travel to the northern city of Hamburg on Friday, where they will visit a memorial of one of its main churches, which was bombed by British and American forces during World War II. While in Germany, the king, who is known for his environmental agenda, will also visit an organic farm and discuss green energy. In Germany, interest in the visit hasn\\'t matched that sparked by previous trips by Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles\\'s mother, with most large newspapers giving it only cursory treatment ahead of the trip.

The decision comes ahead of a May meeting of foreign ministers from the regional grouping, where Iran recently gained full member status. The move is part of a broad effort in Saudi Arabia and some neighboring Persian Gulf countries to expand diplomatic partnerships beyond traditional Western allies in a marked pivot to the east, analysts say. It comes amid uncertainty about Washington\\'s long-term commitment to ensure security in the strategic, energy-rich region, where the U.S. has been a dominant force for decades but is increasingly focused on a rising China and a belligerent Russia. In a sign of the geopolitical realignment under way in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia re-established diplomatic relations with rival Iran this month in a deal brokered by China that burnished Beijing\\'s credentials as a new power broker in the region. The Saudi kingdom is also nearing an agreement to restore ties with Syria following negotiations mediated by Russia. The SCO has historically had a heavy focus on regional security cooperation, and accelerated Saudi interactions with China and Russia there risk backlash from the U.S., which is wary of its traditional security partners in the region cozying up to its global rivals. \"By engaging with these U.S. rivals, it really does seem like this multipolarity is in full-bore here now,\" said Jonathan Fulton, an expert on China-Middle East relations and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. \"We\\'re seeing what a less U.S.-centered Gulf or Middle East looks like.\" Analysts say China isn\\'t trying to replace the broad American role in the Middle East, where the U.S.\\'s continued military presence is unrivaled, but could chip away at its supremacy in the region. Saudi Arabia and China are building on ties that, until now, were firmly rooted in energy and trade, as Beijing\\'s oil imports swelled over the last three decades in line with its expanding economy. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\\'s de facto ruler, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Tuesday, reaffirming their strategic relationship which Mr. Xi said was in \"the best shape of all time,\" according to Chinese state media. China is Saudi Arabia\\'s top trading partner. Besides oil, business has expanded to include large contracts for Chinese construction companies, widespread adoption of Chinese technology despite security concerns and the transfer of military hardware such as drones and ballistic missiles. China is also helping the Saudis fabricate uranium yellowcake, which is needed for a nuclear-energy program or nuclear-arms capability. Earlier this week, the two countries signed major deals that saw state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco take a $3.6 billion stake in Rongsheng Petrochemical Co. Ltd. to expand its downstream presence in China and join with Norinco Group and Panjin Xincheng Industrial Group to construct an integrated refinery and petrochemical complex in northeast China. The refinery and petrochemical complex is expected to produce 300,000 barrels a day at a cost of 83.7 billion yuan, equivalent to $12.2 billion. The deal was first agreed during a visit by Prince Mohammed to Beijing in 2019. Earlier in March, Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser said the company, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., was continuing to give priority to downstream assets in large markets such as China. \"We think China will continue to grow in terms of demand,\" Mr. Nasser said. \"We have a number of investments, but we cannot declare right now, but hopefully in the next one to two years, even through 2023, we are going to have a number of investments in China. The announcements by Aramco coincide with Russia overtaking Saudi Arabia as China\\'s main oil supplier in the first two months of 2023. Saudi Arabia was China\\'s top crude supplier in 2022, selling 1.75 million barrels a day, according to data from China\\'s General Administration of Customs. Aramco had previously considered selling shares on a global exchange but eventually floated shares on its local exchange in 2019 for a $29.4 billion listing that was the world\\'s largest-ever initial public offering . Hong Kong officials are now vying for a second chance at winning a secondary listing, which would be a boon for the city. By listing there, Aramco could tap demand from investors in mainland China.

Vice President Kamala Harris pledged Tuesday in Ghana\\'s seaside capital to \"double down\" on efforts to bring billions of dollars in investments to Africa, a continent that many Western investors still view as high risk . Ms. Harris is the highest ranking in a string of top White House and Biden administration officials to travel through Africa this year, promising to unlock American investment as both the U.S. and China look to tap into the continent\\'s vast natural resources. But U.S. and other Western investors often cite corruption, poor infrastructure and still rampant poverty, all of which preclude easily operating across dozens of countries that all have their own rules and market peculiarities. U.S. interest in expanding influence on the continent comes as tensions and competition with China are rising. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, Chinese companies have spent over a decade and billions of dollars buying out U.S. and European miners in the country\\'s cobalt and copper belt. Experts say the U.S. has a lot of ground to make up, especially in areas of strategic importance, like securing supply chains for materials such as battery metals, critical for the energy transition. \"The Chinese system is a lot more centralized, and state power plays a much larger role,\" said Cobus van Staden, Johannesburg-based managing editor of the China-Global South Project, formerly known as The China Africa Project, a nonprofit. \"The Chinese view on Africa has been very opportunity focused. There is this very strong focus on risk in the U.S. private sector, to the exclusion of all of the opportunities.\" The U.S. financed roughly $14 billion worth of projects on the continent from 2007 to 2020, while comparable Chinese institutions financed about $120 billion over the same period of time, according to an analysis by Oyintarelado Moses, a data analyst with the Global China Initiative at Boston University\\'s Global Development Policy Center, using data from the U.S. government and the Chinese Loans to Africa Database. Ms. Harris\\'s trip follows visits to various African nations by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield this year, but U.S. officials still face deeply-entrenched institutional hurdles to counter Chinese economic dominance on the continent. \"In terms of perception, I think [the U.S. is] doing everything right,\" said Gyude Moore, senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development and Liberia\\'s former Minister of Public Works. The stumbling blocks that remain include a lack of available infrastructure financing from the U.S., easier access to higher education in China for Africans versus the U.S., and concerns that this U.S. push into Africa might be episodic, he said. \"There\\'s a lingering threat that a change in administration will return Africa to the cold again,\" Mr. Moore said. On Wednesday Ms. Harris appeared at the Mix Design Hub, a stylish, four-story office space and gallery in Accra\\'s trendy Osu neighborhood, and announced about $1 billion of new programs and investments on the continent aimed at empowering African business women —much of it from foundations. They include nearly $500 million to provide African women more access to technology, and she said that the U.S. will join with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to launch a new fund to help close the so-called gender digital divide. Other new funds include $500 million from the Nigeria-based Tony Elumelu Foundation, with a large chunk earmarked specifically to support female entrepreneurs. \"There\\'s a direct correlation between policies that are directed at the economic empowerment of women and the general prosperity of societies,\" Ms. Harris said Wednesday morning surrounded by women business-owners. But structural problems persist for U.S. companies that want to expand operations on the continent. Bobby Pittman, the founder of Kupanda Capital and an investor in Mavin Records, a leading record label on the continent, said that U.S. public lending institutions are seen as slower and more bureaucratic than their Chinese counterparts. With China, he said, \"all the financing comes with one signature,\" while the U.S. can take months to help companies finance large-scale projects on the continent. Others say the tide is shifting as demand in some sectors increases. Rob Still, a partner at Denham Capital Management LP, a U.S.-based global energy transition investment firm, said projects for commodities such as cobalt, niobium, lithium and tin would previously have been turned down immediately by more risk-averse Western development agencies because those commodities can\\'t be hedged through an exchange on a futures market—either because the market is too thin or doesn\\'t exist. Now, that is no longer the case. \"There\\'s definitely more interest and action than there has been in the past,\" especially from the Americans, said Mr. Still, who is based in Johannesburg. On the second day of President Biden\\'s summit with African leaders in Washington, D.C., in December, the U.S. government announced that KoBold Metals, a commercial startup backed by Bill Gates\\'s Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which aims to use artificial intelligence to find metals needed for the electric-vehicle boom, agreed to invest $150 million to buy a controlling stake in a large, undeveloped copper deposit in Zambia. The deal is part of the U.S. government\\'s new push into critical minerals in Africa. \"We sought out the U.S. government generally for support on our activities in Zambia,\" said Josh Goldman, KoBold\\'s president. \"We just want a smooth path for deploying lots of capital.\" Zambia\\'s president sees the investment as a sign of bigger things to come: \"It is important. When one investment comes, you are likely to get a second one,\" Hakainde Hichilema told The Wall Street Journal. U.S. officials have also highlighted that Chinese financing often comes with strings attached, such as using Chinese companies and Chinese-made materials. Ms. Harris alluded to the complications of taking money from Beijing during a news conference at the Ghanaian presidential palace Monday, referencing a need to \"ease the debt burden that is facing far too many countries,\" without mentioning China by name. Chinese lenders account for 12% of Africa\\'s private and public external debt, according to a December 2022 Chatham House report. Ghana and Zambia, two countries that Ms. Harris is visiting, are both currently looking to Beijing for relief. \"We are concerned with what is happening on the globe as a whole, we are clear-eyed about that,\" Ms. Harris said when asked Monday in Accra about how much the rise of China figures into her trip. \"But this trip is motivated by the importance of the direct relationship between the United States and Ghana, and as I travel the continent, those countries.\" Gabriele Steinhauser contributed to this article.

The March 25 email from YouTube\\'s Neal Mohan, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, came in response to a letter sent two weeks earlier from the leader of a group of overseas Indians who support Mr. Gandhi\\'s Congress party. The letter, which was reviewed by the Journal, included data from Mr. Gandhi\\'s social-media team making the case that his videos related to \"the issue of cronyism of the ruling government with one industrialist, Mr. Gautam Adani,\" are receiving views that are significantly lower than YouTube analytics suggest they should be, and are being \"suppressed, perhaps unwittingly and algorithmically.\" The data, which was reviewed by the Journal, showed that based on interactions such as likes on two videos alleging Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given special treatment to the company headed by Mr. Adani, the Adani Group, the videos should have received about 2.8 million views combined, but instead got less than a third of that. The data also suggested Mr. Gandhi\\'s videos are receiving fewer views because they are now recommended less frequently to users via YouTube\\'s home page, the letter said. \"Thanks,\" Mr. Mohan wrote in reply. \"Team is taking a look,\" he wrote, without elaborating. Representatives for Alphabet Inc.\\'s Google and YouTube didn\\'t respond to requests for comment. Representatives for the Prime Minister\\'s Office, Mr. Modi\\'s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the Adani Group didn\\'t immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Gandhi and other opposition parties have been pressing Mr. Modi\\'s government to investigate allegations of stock-price manipulation and fraud involving the Adani Group, which had worked closely with the government in modernizing airports, ports and other infrastructure. U.S. short seller Hindenburg Research in January accused the energy and infrastructure conglomerate of improprieties such as using shell companies to manipulate its share prices. The Adani Group has denied the allegations . Google, like other U.S. tech titans, has been in New Delhi\\'s crosshairs in recent years as Mr. Modi\\'s government has tightened rules on foreign e-commerce players and moved to tamp down online dissent on platforms such as Twitter Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc.\\'s Facebook. Google in January lost an appeal in India\\'s Supreme Court to block an antitrust order that requires it to make significant changes to the way its Android operating system does business with smartphone makers, app developers and users. Mr. Mohan, previously YouTube\\'s chief product officer, became head of YouTube in February after longtime chief executive Susan Wojcicki stepped down. Mr. Gandhi in 2021 wrote to Twitter Inc.\\'s chief executive alleging he was the victim of a government campaign to limit his ability to attract new followers on the platform. His account then began gaining new followers at a rapid clip. India\\'s Parliament on Friday disqualified Mr. Gandhi as a lawmaker after a lower court convicted and sentenced him to two years in prison in a defamation case over remarks he made in a 2019 campaign speech referring to \"thieves\" as having the surname Modi. Mr. Gandhi\\'s Congress party plans to appeal the conviction soon, according to party leaders. If the appeal is accepted, Mr. Gandhi would be able to retake his seat in the legislature. Write to Newley Purnell at newley.purnell@wsj.com', 'WASHINGTON -- Republicans and Democrats are sparring over measures in the $53 billion Chips Act that the Biden administration says are needed to ensure the measure\\'s success, but which Republicans say are an effort to pursue liberal social policies. The Commerce Department has set rules for semiconductor companies seeking grants under the act that encourage the hiring of union workforces and economically disadvantaged individuals. Companies seeking more than $150 million must provide child care. A group of Republican senators including Ted Cruz of Texas and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee recently wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo saying the measures will make \"domestic chip production more expensive, less competitive, and reliant on taxpayer subsidies over private investment.\" In an interview, Ms. Raimondo pushed back on those claims. She said measures such as requiring chip makers to pay prevailing wages and provide child care are necessary to address a workforce shortage that could hinder efforts to expand semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. \"There is zero \\'social policy\\' that we\\'re trying to achieve here,\" Ms. Raimondo said. She added that the success of the Chips Act largely hinges on overcoming a labor shortage that could imperil plans to compete with China. \"We want them to show us a workforce plan, including how they think about child care, not because we have a social agenda but because we know [that] they\\'re struggling to hire workers,\" Ms. Raimondo said. Ms. Raimondo joined President Biden in North Carolina on Tuesday for a visit to a semiconductor manufacturer in Durham that has plans to build a $5 billion chip-manufacturing plant projected to create 1,800 new jobs. During the visit, Mr. Biden said more than $435 billion in private sector manufacturing commitments have been made since he took office. A White House official said those investments would span at least the next decade and include more than $200 billion in clean energy, electric vehicle and battery investments, over $200 billion in semiconductors, and about $15 billion in biomanufacturing investments. Mr. Biden said the U.S. is \"determined to lead the world in the manufacturing of semiconductors.\" He also aimed at Republicans who have proposed cuts to government spending, saying doing so would cede \"the future of innovation and technology to China.\" In their letter, dated March 22, 14 Republican senators said that many of the rules the Biden administration has imposed on chip subsidy applicants weren\\'t specified in the Chips Act. Their criticism echoed prior complaints from Republicans that conditions for companies applying for semiconductor funding are being used \"to pursue controversial policies that go beyond the requirements of the law.\"', 'WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Kevin McCarthy tried to prod President Biden into starting talks over spending cuts as a condition for raising the debt ceiling, just as Republicans are struggling to unite around a blueprint for negotiations ahead of dual deadlines later this year. The White House released its own budget proposal earlier this month and has said it won\\'t negotiate on spending until Republicans put forward their own plan. Mr. McCarthy has rejected that notion and said in a letter to Mr. Biden that talks should start as soon as possible. \"The budget has nothing to do with the debt ceiling,\" Mr. McCarthy told reporters. In his letter to Mr. Biden on Tuesday morning, the California Republican reiterated that he wanted to roll back nondefense discretionary spending and lock in low annual increases from there, while also proposing clawing back unspent Covid-19 relief funds and strengthening work requirements for social programs. He also called for measures to lower energy costs and secure the border, two priorities for House Republicans. The White House dismissed the letter, calling again for the House to pass a debt-ceiling increase with no spending cuts attached -- leaving any talks at an impasse. Mr. Biden has said the debt limit needed to be raised without conditions but has said he would engage in discussions over taxes and spending once Mr. McCarthy produces his budget plan. Many lawmakers expect the GOP budget to be completed in May or later. Mr. Biden responded in his own letter late Tuesday, telling Mr. McCarthy he looked forward to \"talking about our nation\\'s economic and fiscal future\" separate from the debt ceiling. \"But for that conversation to be productive, we should both tell the American people what we are for,\" he said. The Treasury Department ran up against the roughly $31.4 trillion debt limit in January.

The event kicked off a three-week tour that will see Mr. Biden and other top administration officials visit key battleground states to tout legislative accomplishments as the president gears up for a likely re-election campaign where the impact of his domestic economic policies is expected to be a core theme. Mr. Biden said the U.S. is \"determined to lead the world in the manufacturing of semiconductors.\" He also took aim at Republicans who have proposed cuts to government spending, arguing that doing so \"would mean ceding the future of innovation and technology to China.\" He added, \"We\\'re not going to let them undo all the progress we made.\" Mr. Biden\\'s approval rating neared the lowest point of his presidency in a new poll while another recent survey found most Americans think the president has accomplished \"not very much\" or \"little or nothing\" during his tenure. Mr. Biden and his administration are now ramping up efforts to sell the impact of its policies as the president begins making the case for a second term, although he has yet to formally launch his re-election campaign. In their letter, dated March 22, the 14 Republican senators said that many of the rules the Biden administration has imposed on chip subsidy applicants weren\\'t specified in the Chips Act. Their criticism echoed prior complaints from Republicans that conditions for companies applying for the first round of semiconductor funding are being used \"as a tool to pursue controversial policies that go beyond the requirements of the law.\" This includes sharing profit that exceed projections with the government and favoring applicants who commit to pursuing \"environmental justice\" measures. The Republicans said the Commerce Department\\'s criteria will add to companies\\' costs for building facilities and making the U.S. less competitive against other manufacturing nations. Ms. Raimondo said preferences added by the department on child care and workforce development are aimed at speeding up the launch of the projects amid the shortage of workers. She said that the department will take a holistic approach and negotiate terms of the agreement flexibly with individual companies as it applies the criteria stated in the application materials. She added that the department\\'s primary goal is to get the projects up and running quickly and efficiently, and that the request to submit plans is to make sure the projects are built on time and on budget and staffed effectively. \"The way you\\'re going to meet your workforce needs in rural Idaho is different than in Texas or New York,\" she said. \"We\\'re not going to predetermine the way they fulfill these projects.\" The Chips Act passed Congress with bipartisan support last year, marking another bipartisan achievement for Mr. Biden after the passage of the $1 trillion infrastructure law in November 2021. In the Senate, 17 Republicans joined a nearly unanimous Democratic caucus in favor of the bill, while two dozen Republicans crossed party lines to help pass it in the House. Ms. Raimondo lobbied both Democrats and Republicans amid negotiations around the legislation, with an emphasis on the national-security concerns of continuing to rely on Taiwan or U.S. adversaries for semiconductors. Companies building leading-edge chip factories in the U.S. can begin applying for the Chips Act funds Friday. The application process for companies looking to build current generation and mature technology facilities opens June 26. Write to Sabrina Siddiqui at sabrina.siddiqui@wsj.com and Yuka Hayashi at Yuka.Hayashi@wsj.com', 'The U.S. and China have described Taiwan as the most volatile flashpoint in their increasingly fraught bilateral relations. Now, after months of sparring by Washington and Beijing over the Ukraine war, a suspected surveillance balloon , TikTok and other issues, Taiwan is set to return to the center of great power tensions, with the island\\'s leader traveling to the U.S. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen is stopping in New York and Los Angeles on her way to and from Central America, with plans to meet House Speaker Kevin McCarthy next week in California. Some in the Biden administration are concerned that the visit will give Beijing the pretext to conduct military exercises near the island , as it did last summer, or erode Taiwan\\'s security in other ways, according to officials. As Ms. Tsai\\'s arrival in New York on Wednesday approaches, U.S. officials have been sounding out Ms. Tsai\\'s government to ensure her trip stays within past norms, while also urging Beijing against reacting strongly , the officials and people familiar with the talks said. Visits by Taiwanese presidents to the U.S. are always carefully managed affairs, with Washington trying to give the island\\'s leaders a way to show that their government has U.S. support, without giving Beijing an opening for forceful retaliation. How the three governments handle the visit is likely to determine whether Washington- Beijing relations deteriorate further. All three are readying their militaries for a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is a longstanding U.S. partner that Beijing regards as its territory, and domestic politics make compromise difficult for each. \"There is a possibility that the transit, if not carefully handled, could blow up in everybody\\'s face,\" said Bonnie Glaser, who heads the Indo-Pacific program at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S. \"It could end up with a major display of military force by the Chinese, which will introduce even more friction into the U.S.-China relationship,\" she said. China, which stated its displeasure at Ms. Tsai\\'s trip, opened formal diplomatic relations over the weekend with Honduras , which cut its decades-old ties with Taiwan. Ms. Tsai\\'s trip takes her to two of Taiwan\\'s 13 remaining diplomatic partners, Guatemala and Belize, neighbors of Honduras. Ms. Tsai\\'s stops in the U.S. are officially called \"transit\" visits—language that is part of the delicate diplomacy meant to maintain a U.S.-China-Taiwan equilibrium . Taiwanese presidents have made dozens of such visits over the years, including several by Ms. Tsai, with minimal pushback from Beijing , Biden administration officials said. \"There is no reason for Beijing to turn this transit, which is consistent with longstanding U.S. policy, into something it is not or use it to overreact,\" the State Department said. But China carefully scrutinizes the visits for signs that the U.S. and Taiwan are testing the limits of Beijing\\'s tolerance, and Taiwan\\'s leaders at times have pushed the envelope to try to show their influence in the U.S. House Speaker McCarthy would be the highest-level U.S. politician to meet a Taiwan president on American soil since the transit visits started. Ties now between Taiwan and the U.S. are more robust than at any time since Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, according to officials and political analysts, with more communication among defense officials and higher-level contacts between the governments. That closeness puts immense pressure on Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who has said the Taiwan issue should not be passed from generation to generation. Beijing has put off U.S. requests earlier this month for Mr. Xi and President Biden to speak by phone in an effort by the administration to settle some of the recent rancor. Beijing wants to wait to see how Ms. Tsai\\'s visit plays out before agreeing to any leader-level call, Chinese officials said. \"We strongly oppose any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, strongly oppose any U.S. visit by the leader of the Taiwan authorities regardless of the rationale or pretext,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters last week. \"The reported trip is not so much a \\'transit,\\' but an attempt to seek breakthroughs and propagate \\'Taiwan independence.\\'\" A successful trip would help Ms. Tsai show that her party can manage close relations with the U.S. without provoking a harsh response from Beijing. That would boost her current vice president\\'s chances of winning a pivotal election to succeed her early next year when her two terms as president end. \"China has been ramping up its aggressive behavior and this is a general concern,\" said Kolas Yotaka, a spokeswoman for Ms. Tsai. \"We think the best response is deeper cooperation with our partners to safeguard peace in the region and protect our common democratic values.\" This week, Ms. Tsai\\'s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, began a 12-day tour of China, the first former president of Taiwan to set foot in the mainland since 1949. Ms. Tsai\\'s office has sought to play down the China trip by Mr. Ma, who favored closer ties with Beijing when he was president between 2008 and 2016. Some lawmakers from Mr. Ma\\'s party, the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, and members of the public have voiced concern that the island might be dragged into war as part of U.S.-China rivalry. Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, along with Beijing\\'s stepped-up military pressure on Taiwan, has created a sense of urgency within Ms. Tsai\\'s government and the U.S. about the need to harden Taiwan for eventual conflict . Early this year, Washington and Beijing seemed poised for detente. Tensions had subsided from their last bout of friction over Taiwan: then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\'s visit to the island in August . Then, the U.S. detected the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon crossing North America and delayed high-level talks with Beijing before shooting down the craft, further angering Chinese leadership. Both sides have drawn sharper lines over the war in Ukraine, with Mr. Xi holding a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week. Beijing, which has bolstered Moscow by buying energy and boosting trade, has tried to position itself as a potential peacemaker and portrayed the U.S. as irresponsible for arming Kyiv. One concern for the administration is a closed-door reception on Thursday in New York by the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, to award Ms. Tsai its global leadership award. A current fellow at the institute is Mike Pompeo, the former Trump administration secretary of state who, while visiting Taiwan last year, urged in a Facebook post that the U.S. grant formal diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. The Biden administration has said U.S. policy remains unchanged. A move to formal recognition of Taiwan would likely be seen by Beijing as a reneging on four decades of U.S. diplomatic commitments and potentially cross a red line China has set out for triggering military action. Hudson said Mr. Pompeo isn\\'t attending. The think tank declined to release a list of invitees and other details of the event. On her way back from visiting Guatemala and Belize, Ms. Tsai is due to meet at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library with House Speaker McCarthy. Other Republican members of Congress, including Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, who leads a special committee on U.S. competition with China\\'s Communist Party, are expected to attend. Taiwan\\'s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said last week that Ms. Tsai would also meet with members of the Democratic Party. In Taipei, government and ruling party officials are concerned that any misstep during Ms. Tsai\\'s trip might put further strain on its troubled relationship with Beijing—or mar relations with Washington. Some lawmakers in the opposition Kuomintang, along with pro-opposition media and a number of academics, have suggested that the U.S. is treating Taiwan like a pawn in its competition with Beijing. Some pointed to chipmaking powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\\'s decision to build a $40 billion facto ry in Arizona, saying it amounts to forced technology transfer that primarily benefits the U.S. \"The Americans are our good friends and have helped us so much over the past several decades, but I remain skeptical,\" Kuomintang lawmaker Wu Sz-huai said during an appearance by Taiwan\\'s foreign minister before the legislature last week. \"They put their own national interests first, not Taiwan\\'s national interests.\" Taiwan\\'s government has characterized some of the criticisms as misinformation designed to weaken ties between Washington and Taipei and predicted such attacks would intensify ahead of the 2024 presidential election.

Write to Natalie Andrews at natalie.andrews@wsj.com'], ['WASHINGTON—House Speaker Kevin McCarthy tried to prod President Biden into starting talks over spending cuts as a condition for raising the debt ceiling , just as Republicans are struggling to unite around a blueprint for negotiations ahead of dual deadlines later this year. The White House released its own budget proposal earlier this month and has said it won\\'t negotiate on spending until Republicans put forward their own plan. Mr. McCarthy has rejected that notion and said in a letter to Mr. Biden that talks should start as soon as possible. While neither budget would have a chance of becoming law, they serve to outline the parties\\' policy intentions. \"The budget has nothing to do with the debt ceiling,\" Mr. McCarthy told reporters . \"Let\\'s get the debt ceiling done and stop playing games.\" In his letter to Mr. Biden on Tuesday morning, the California Republican reiterated that he wanted to roll back nondefense discretionary spending and lock in low annual increases from there, while also proposing clawing back unspent Covid-19 relief funds and strengthening work requirements for social programs. He also called for measures to lower energy costs and secure the border, two priorities for House Republicans. The White House dismissed the letter, calling again for the House to pass a debt ceiling increase with no spending cuts attached—leaving any talks at an impasse. Mr. Biden has said the debt limit needed to be raised without conditions but has said he would engage in discussions over taxes and spending once Mr. McCarthy produces his budget plan. Many lawmakers expect the GOP budget to be completed in May or later. Mr. Biden \"has put forward his budget, and all he\\'s asking in return is to see what the House Republicans will put forward. I think that\\'s pretty reasonable,\" said White House spokeswoman Olivia Dalton. The Treasury Departmen t ran up against the roughly $31.4 trillion debt limit in January. It is now deploying a series of special accounting maneuvers to keep paying the government\\'s obligations to bondholders, Social Security recipients and others. The U.S. could become unable to pay all of its bills as soon as this summer. \"At the moment, I don\\'t see how we get there,\" Rep.

Write to Natalie Andrews at natalie.andrews@wsj.com', 'The U.S. and China have described Taiwan as the most volatile flashpoint in their increasingly fraught bilateral relations. Now, after months of sparring by Washington and Beijing over the Ukraine war, a suspected surveillance balloon , TikTok and other issues, Taiwan is set to return to the center of great power tensions, with the island\\'s leader traveling to the U.S. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen is stopping in New York and Los Angeles on her way to and from Central America, with plans to meet House Speaker Kevin McCarthy next week in California. Some in the Biden administration are concerned that the visit will give Beijing the pretext to conduct military exercises near the island , as it did last summer, or erode Taiwan\\'s security in other ways, according to officials. As Ms. Tsai\\'s arrival in New York on Wednesday approaches, U.S. officials have been sounding out Ms. Tsai\\'s government to ensure her trip stays within past norms, while also urging Beijing against reacting strongly , the officials and people familiar with the talks said. Visits by Taiwanese presidents to the U.S. are always carefully managed affairs, with Washington trying to give the island\\'s leaders a way to show their government has U.S. support, without giving Beijing an opening for forceful retaliation. How the three governments handle the visit is likely to determine whether Washington- Beijing relations deteriorate further. All three are readying their militaries for a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is a longstanding U.S. partner that Beijing regards as its territory, and domestic politics make compromise difficult for each. \"There is a possibility that the transit, if not carefully handled, could blow up in everybody\\'s face,\" said Bonnie Glaser, who heads the Indo-Pacific program at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S. \"It could end up with a major display of military force by the Chinese, which will introduce even more friction into the U.S.-China relationship,\" she said. China, which stated its displeasure at Ms. Tsai\\'s trip, opened formal diplomatic relations over the weekend with Honduras , which cut its decades-old ties with Taiwan. Ms. Tsai\\'s trip takes her to two of Taiwan\\'s 13 remaining diplomatic partners, Guatemala and Belize, neighbors of Honduras. Ms. Tsai\\'s stops in the U.S. are officially called \"transit\" visits—language that is part of the delicate diplomacy meant to maintain a U.S.-China-Taiwan equilibrium . Taiwanese presidents have made dozens of such visits over the years, including several by Ms. Tsai, with, Biden administration officials said, minimal pushback from Beijing . \"There is no reason for Beijing to turn this transit, which is consistent with longstanding U.S. policy, into something it is not or use it to overreact,\" the State Department said. But China carefully scrutinizes the visits for signs that the U.S. and Taiwan are testing the limits of Beijing\\'s tolerance, and Taiwan\\'s leaders at times have pushed the envelope to try to show their influence in the U.S. House Speaker McCarthy would be the highest-level U.S. politician to meet a Taiwan president on American soil since the transit visits started. Ties now between Taiwan and the U.S. are more robust than at any time since Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, according to officials and political analysts, with more communication among defense officials and higher-level contacts between the governments. That closeness puts immense pressure on Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who has said China\\'s goal of taking control of Taiwan should not be left to the next generation. Beijing has put off U.S. requests earlier this month for Mr. Xi and President Biden to speak by phone in an effort by the administration to settle some of the recent rancor. Beijing wants to wait to see how Ms. Tsai\\'s visit plays out before agreeing to any leader-level call, Chinese officials said. \"We strongly oppose any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, strongly oppose any U.S. visit by the leader of the Taiwan authorities regardless of the rationale or pretext,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters last week. \"The reported trip is not so much a \\'transit,\\' but an attempt to seek breakthroughs and propagate \\'Taiwan independence.\\'\" A successful trip would help Ms. Tsai show that her party can manage close relations with the U.S. without provoking a harsh response from Beijing. That would boost her current vice president\\'s chances of winning a pivotal election to succeed her early next year when her two terms as president end. \"China has been ramping up its aggressive behavior and this is a general concern,\" said Kolas Yotaka, a spokeswoman for Ms. Tsai. \"We think the best response is deeper cooperation with our partners to safeguard peace in the region and protect our common democratic values.\" This week, Ms. Tsai\\'s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, began a 12-day tour of China, the first former president of Taiwan to set foot in the mainland since 1949. Ms. Tsai\\'s office has sought to play down the China trip by Mr. Ma, who favored closer ties with Beijing when he was president between 2008 and 2016. Some lawmakers from Mr. Ma\\'s party, the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, and members of the public have voiced concern that the island might be dragged into war as part of U.S.-China rivalry. Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, along with Beijing\\'s stepped-up military pressure on Taiwan, has created a sense of urgency within Ms. Tsai\\'s government and the U.S. about the need to harden Taiwan for eventual conflict . Early this year, Washington and Beijing seemed poised for detente. Tensions had subsided from their last bout of friction over Taiwan: then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\'s visit to the island in August . Then, the U.S. detected the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon crossing North America and delayed high-level talks with Beijing before shooting down the craft, further angering the Chinese leadership. Both sides have drawn sharper lines over the war in Ukraine, with Mr. Xi holding a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week. Beijing, which has bolstered Moscow by buying energy and boosting trade, has tried to position itself as a potential peacemaker and portrayed the U.S. as irresponsible for arming Kyiv. One concern for the administration is a closed-door reception on Thursday in New York by the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, to award Ms. Tsai its global leadership award. A current fellow at the institute is Mike Pompeo, the former Trump administration secretary of state who, while visiting Taiwan last year, urged in a Facebook post that the U.S. grant formal diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. The Biden administration has said U.S. policy remains unchanged. A move to formal recognition of Taiwan would likely be seen by Beijing as a reneging on four decades of U.S. diplomatic commitments and potentially cross a red line China has set out for triggering military action. The think tank declined to release a list of invitees and other details of the event. A spokesman for Mr. Pompeo didn\\'t immediately respond to a request for comment. On her way back from visiting Guatemala and Belize, Ms. Tsai is due to meet at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library with House Speaker McCarthy. Other Republican members of Congress, including Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, who leads a special committee on U.S. competition with China\\'s Communist Party, are expected to attend. Taiwan\\'s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said last week that Ms. Tsai would also meet with members of the Democratic Party. In Taipei, government and ruling party officials are concerned that any misstep during Ms. Tsai\\'s trip may put further strain on its troubled relationship with Beijing—or mar relations with Washington. Some lawmakers in the opposition Kuomintang, along with pro-opposition media and a number of academics, have suggested that the U.S. is treating Taiwan like a pawn in its competition with Beijing. Some pointed to chipmaking powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\\'s decision to build a $40 billion facto ry in Arizona, saying it amounts to forced technology transfer that primarily benefits the U.S. \"The Americans are our good friends and have helped us so much over the past several decades, but I remain skeptical,\" Kuomintang lawmaker Wu Sz-huai said during an appearance by Taiwan\\'s foreign minister before the legislature last week. \"They put their own national interests first, not Taiwan\\'s national interests.\" Taiwan\\'s government has characterized some of the criticisms as misinformation designed to weaken ties between Washington and Taipei and predicted such attacks would intensify ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Write to Charles Hutzler at charles.hutzler@wsj.com and Joyu Wang at joyu.wang@wsj.com', 'HOUSTON—Wael Sawan knows he is about to make some people very unhappy. The new chief executive of Shell PLC is in the midst of crafting his business plan for the London-based energy giant, including whether to increase oil production. Doing so would please many investors looking to build on last year\\'s oil-and-gas bonanza, which produced record annual earnings for Shell. But it almost certainly would generate howls of protest from environmentalists and other critics, including investors who want Shell to tackle climate-related goals more aggressively. Those investors argue a continued focus on fossil fuels endangers Shell\\'s long-term prospects in a changing world. Mr. Sawan says he is committed to lowering the company\\'s emissions and helping develop a new generation of clean-energy sources. But that is not where the bulk of profits are right now. \"I fundamentally believe in the role of oil and gas for a long, long time to come,\" he said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal. What\\'s more, he said, he doesn\\'t believe renewable- and low-carbon energy projects should be subsidized by Shell\\'s fossil-fuel profits, but should deliver returns that merit continued investment on their own. \"We\\'re definitely taking a hard look at the portfolio,\" Mr. Sawan said. All options are on the table , he said, including revising the company\\'s 2021 forecast for an average 1% to 2% decrease in its crude output each year until 2030. Mr. Sawan also said he was weighing further exploration for new sources of oil and gas in areas where Shell doesn\\'t currently operate. He cautioned that Shell\\'s production targets and other key decisions are still being debated by its executives and board. Whatever he decides, Mr. Sawan expects to be unpopular among some groups, and maybe factions of all of them. \"I think the heat will come no matter what I do,\" he said. Shell has scheduled an update for investors on June 14 in New York. Finding the balance between fossil fuels and lower-carbon alternatives is a big challenge facing the CEOs of the biggest energy companies . The task is particularly acute for Mr. Sawan and Shell, Europe\\'s biggest energy company, which moved to the U.K. after a Dutch court ruled in 2021 that it was partially responsible for climate change and must reduce its carbon emissions. Shell is appealing the ruling, arguing that it is being unreasonably singled out. In the U.K. and European continent, governments are clawing back portions of record profits earned last year by oil-and-gas companies as energy costs soared amid Russia\\'s war in Ukraine. Less than a year ago, Shell\\'s annual shareholder meeting in London was delayed by almost three hours by climate activists attending as shareholders, who glued themselves to chairs and chanted against the company\\'s continued spending on fossil fuels. Mr. Sawan, who joined Shell in 1997 at the age of 22, now becomes its public face . Born in Lebanon, Mr. Sawan grew up mostly in Dubai and studied chemical engineering in Montreal. A dual Lebanese-Canadian national, Mr. Sawan is the first non-European CEO in Shell\\'s history. Mr. Sawan is considered by colleagues inside and outside the company to be a technically adept manager, including in his most recent job overseeing Shell\\'s massive liquefied natural gas business, typically its biggest cash engine. He also took over responsibility for renewables on his final stretch toward the CEO job. Wael Sawan is Shell\\'s first non-European CEO. PHOTO: Mary Turner for The Wall Street Journal In addition to Europe and the Middle East, he has worked on the U.S. Gulf Coast and run businesses including global deep-water operations and companywide oil-and-gas exploration and production, known as upstream. A pivotal time in his career, according to people who know him, came in 1999 when, after working his first couple of years in Oman, he scored highly on the business-school entrance exam and considered leaving Shell to pursue his graduate business degree at Harvard University. Andy Brown, at the time his boss and later head of all upstream production for Shell, said he persuaded Mr. Sawan not to leave, but to get his M.B.A. with Shell\\'s support and then afterward to return to the company. He later followed in Mr. Brown\\'s footsteps in the Middle East overseeing Shell\\'s Qatar operations. \"It was clear that Wael was a great talent,\" Mr. Brown said. \"When you\\'re 24, it is about, is the guy smart and can he work through issues and problems?\" He said Mr. Sawan was especially skilled at developing relationships with business partners and government officials. That proved a valuable asset as Mr. Sawan traveled the world, people who know him said. He could defuse tensions by connecting with government leaders and executives over a shared love of soccer, or regional food, they said. In Qatar, Mr. Sawan helped steer a huge natural-gas refinery development project through cost hurdles and delays, earning internal recognition for his diplomacy with government officials and other partners, people involved in the project say. People close to Mr. Sawan said they expect him to be tested at the helm, not just by navigating Shell\\'s business challenges but also by what they describe as his natural reluctance to confide in fellow executives, as well as the time he\\'ll be separated from his wife and sons. Since getting the top job last year, Mr. Sawan has spent time consulting with business heads but also periods in near-isolation working through details of businesses in preparation for a full review, people familiar with his schedule said. \"It\\'s a massively intense job, and you sort of need to build the stamina for it,\" Mr. Sawan said. \"I\\'m trying to stick to my gym patterns, my eating patterns, to make sure that you stay sane at the end of it and still enjoy life after it.\" Among the options under consideration is whether it might make sense for Shell to step up exploration for new oil-and-gas sources, Mr. Sawan said. That includes potentially looking far afield for new, untapped oil and gas sources in parts of the world known in the industry as \"frontiers\" because they lack production infrastructure that takes years, sometimes decades, to build into full production. A Shell oil platform at a shipyard in Corpus Christi, Texas. PHOTO: Christopher Lee for The Wall Street Journal Shell said two years ago it plans to end all new frontier exploration by the end of 2025, giving the company a finite window to search for virgin reservoirs of oil and gas where it isn\\'t already operating. Dwindling options for limiting global warming call for a massive and rapid shift away from fossil fuels, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report last week . At the same time, oil demand is continuing to rise, and investors in global oil giants have rewarded companies—including U.S. giants Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp.— for sticking with traditional fossil-fuel production. Shell says it is ahead of its schedule on planned annual 1% to 2% crude-output cuts, from divesting or running off assets more quickly than expected. \"We\\'re almost at the point where we had expected to be by 2030,\" Mr. Sawan said. \"That gives us options to be able to choose how we want to go from here. It\\'s those options that we\\'re assessing.\" To illustrate what he considers a smart approach to new-energy projects, he noted Shell\\'s decision—overseen by him—to build what the company expects to be Europe\\'s largest renewable hydrogen plant, in Rotterdam, once it is up and running in 2025. \"There\\'s a great opportunity for that to be a double-digit return,\" Mr. Sawan said. \"Let\\'s prove the concept. If we can prove the concept, then maybe the second one will be built and the third one, but it has to be done in a measured way.\" Write to Jenny Strasburg at jenny.strasburg@wsj.com', 'WASHINGTON—Republicans and Democrats are sparring over measures in the $53 billion Chips Act that the Biden administration says are needed to ensure the measure\\'s success, but which Republicans say are an effort to pursue liberal social policies. The Commerce Department has set rules for semiconductor companies seeking grants under the act that encourage the hiring of union workforces and economically disadvantaged individuals. Companies seeking more than $150 million must provide child care. A group of Republican U.S. senators including Ted Cruz (R., Texas) and Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) recently wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo saying that the measures will make \"domestic chip production more expensive, less competitive, and reliant on taxpayer subsidies over private investment.\" In an interview, Ms. Raimondo pushed back on those claims. She said measures such as requiring chip makers to pay prevailing wages and provide child care are necessary to address a workforce shortage that could hinder efforts to expand semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. \"There is zero \\'social policy\\' that we\\'re trying to achieve here,\" Ms. Raimondo said. \"We have no desire to put requirements on companies that are bad for the companies.\" She added that the success of the Chips Act largely hinges on overcoming a labor shortage that could imperil plans to compete with China by boosting domestic chip production at home. \"We want them to show us a workforce plan, including how they think about child care, not because we have a social agenda but because we know [that] they\\'re struggling to hire workers,\" Ms. Raimondo said. \"We do need to protect taxpayer money and make sure the projects get done successfully, on time and on budget.\" Ms. Raimondo is expected to join President Biden in North Carolina on Tuesday for a visit to a semiconductor manufacturer in Durham that has plans to build a $5 billion chip-manufacturing plant projected to create 1,800 new jobs. During the visit, Mr. Biden will say that more than $435 billion in private-sector manufacturing commitments have been made since he took office, according to a White House official, who didn\\'t specify a time frame for when the investments would be made. The total includes more than $200 billion in clean energy, electric vehicle and battery investments, over $200 billion in semiconductors, and about $15 billion in biomanufacturing investments. The event will kick off a three-week tour that will see Mr. Biden and other top administration officials visit key battleground states to tout legislative accomplishments as the president gears up for a likely re-election campaign where the impact of his domestic economic policies is expected to be a core theme. Mr. Biden\\'s approval rating neared the lowest point of his presidency in a new poll while another recent survey found most Americans think the president has accomplished \"not very much\" or \"little or nothing\" during his tenure. Mr. Biden and his administration are now ramping up efforts to sell the impact of its policies as the president begins making the case for a second term, although he has yet to formally launch his re-election campaign. In their letter, dated March 22, the 14 Republican senators said that many of the rules the Biden administration has imposed on chip subsidy applicants weren\\'t specified in the Chips Act. Their criticism echoed prior complaints from Republicans that conditions for companies applying for the first round of semiconductor funding are being used \"as a tool to pursue controversial policies that go beyond the requirements of the law.\" This includes sharing profit that exceed projections with the government and favoring applicants who commit to pursuing \"environmental justice\" measures. The Republicans said the Commerce Department\\'s criteria will add to companies\\' costs for building facilities and making the U.S. less competitive against other manufacturing nations. Ms. Raimondo said preferences added by the department on child care and workforce development are aimed at speeding up the launch of the projects amid the shortage of workers. She said that the department will take a holistic approach and negotiate terms of the agreement flexibly with individual companies as it applies the criteria stated in the application materials. She added that the department\\'s primary goal is to get the projects up and running quickly and efficiently, and that the request to submit plans is to make sure the projects are built on time and on budget and staffed effectively. \"The way you\\'re going to meet your workforce needs in rural Idaho is different than in Texas or New York,\" she said. \"We\\'re not going to predetermine the way they fulfill these projects.\" The Chips Act passed Congress with bipartisan support last year, marking another bipartisan achievement for Mr. Biden after the passage of the $1 trillion infrastructure law in November 2021. In the Senate, 17 Republicans joined a nearly unanimous Democratic caucus in favor of the bill, while two dozen Republicans crossed party lines to help pass it in the House. Ms. Raimondo lobbied both Democrats and Republicans amid negotiations around the legislation, with an emphasis on the national-security concerns of continuing to rely on Taiwan or U.S. adversaries for semiconductors. Companies building leading-edge chip factories in the U.S. can begin applying for the Chips Act funds Friday. The application process for companies looking to build current generation and mature technology facilities opens June 26.

The U.S. is negotiating a similar trade agreement with the EU focused on critical minerals, with plans to also try and strike a deal with the U.K. \"This is a welcome moment as the United States continues to work with our allies and partners to strengthen supply chains for critical minerals, including through the Inflation Reduction Act,\" U.S. Trade Rep. Katherine Tai said. The U.S. and Japan are expected to sign the agreement Tuesday, when it will go into effect. Ms. Tai\\'s Japanese counterpart, trade minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, also welcomed the deal, saying minerals such as lithium, cobalt and nickel are important because of rising demand for EV batteries. With the subsidies, the U.S. is trying to encourage companies to develop new supply chains for critical minerals outside of China. As the U.S. relationship with China becomes increasingly adversarial, officials across Washington worry that relying on China for materials crucial for clean-energy technologies could leave the U.S. vulnerable. While China currently dominates the processing and refining of many critical minerals, Biden administration officials believe Japan, which already processes and refines critical minerals, could become a major part of an overhauled supply chain for the goods. Since the Biden administration is using executive authority to reach the agreement with Japan, it will not submit it to Congress for approval. The deal doesn\\'t lift any trading barriers, and a senior Biden administration official said the U.S. and Japan currently impose no export duties for trading critical minerals between their countries. The two countries also agreed to share information about reviewing foreign investments into the minerals sector. Lawmakers in both parties have criticized the administration\\'s push to make the agreements without receiving approval from Congress , calling it a violation of their constitutional authority. Biden administration officials have said they have consulted closely with lawmakers on the efforts. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), a chief architect of the Inflation Reduction Act, has said that he intended for close U.S. allies and partners to meet the sourcing requirement for the electric-vehicle subsidies without needing additional trade agreements. \"I gotta be honest with you. I should have paused and said \\'OK, I\\'m going to make sure our NATO allies are involved in this,\\' \" Mr. Manchin said at a recent energy conference in Houston. Mr. Manchin has been critical of several other choices the Biden administration has made in implementing the law. Biden administration officials see critical minerals agreements with members of the Group of Seven advanced democracies as the first piece of a broader strategy to reorient global supply chains away from China. Western officials have discussed forming a buyers club for critical minerals . Under such a buyers club, wealthy G-7 nations would offer financing and other development support to countries such as Zambia that are rich in the resources—an effort to convince these nations to sell their minerals to the West instead of China. —Yuka Hayashi and Jenny Strasburg contributed to this article.

At a closed-door meeting Monday, Rosie Rios, chair of the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission, secured members\\' approval for her plans, which include gathering suggestions from the public about how the anniversary should be observed. She also intends to ask Congress for a significant increase in the commission\\'s annual appropriation. Ms. Rios, who was U.S. treasurer in the Obama administration, said her new initiative, America\\'s Invitation, would encourage \"the American public to suggest their own ideas, tell their own stories, share interesting narratives about their own experiences, about their own communities.\" Those suggestions would lead to a multiyear planning effort for 2026, she said, and \"a playbook that basically says, \\'Americans have spoken, this is what we want to do.\\'\" The struggles of the anniversary project, known as America250, have included a botched alliance with Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., a defamation suit by one commissioner against others, and a workplace discrimination case against the project pending in federal court. The effort has consumed millions of dollars since Congress created the Semiquincentennial Commission in 2016. Other agencies aren\\'t waiting for America250 to take the lead. \"We\\'re each kind of doing things on our own,\" said Crosby Kemper, who as director of the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services holds a nonvoting seat on the commission. America250, he said, has been so consumed by \"organizational messiness that they haven\\'t gotten terribly far. For a long period of time there hasn\\'t been anyone there for us to talk to.\" Earlier this month, some 300 historians, curators and officials representing Semiquincentennial agencies, museums and historical organizations from more than 30 states met at the Colonial Williamsburg historic site in Virginia to begin nationwide planning on their own. \"We thought, \\'Let\\'s get together, let\\'s collaborate, let\\'s see where we can partner and make this meaningful nationally, across state boundaries,\\'\" said Cheryl Wilson, executive director of the Virginia American Revolution 250 Commission, adding that a couple of America250 commissioners attended. James Grossman, executive director of the American Historical Association, said while Ms. Rios brings new \"energy at the national level,\" other organizations \"have had to go off and say, \\'We are going to do something.\\'\" Congress established the Semiquincentennial Commission to coordinate programs nationwide and made the heads of a dozen federal agencies, including the Library of Congress, the National Archives and the Smithsonian Institution, nonvoting members. Several of those agencies are moving forward with their own projects independent of the commission. Ms. Rios said she welcomed efforts by other groups. Not all the work done by America250 to date was for naught, she said, citing the development of a logo for the anniversary and Congress\\'s approval for the minting of Semiquincentennial coins. Under former Chairman Daniel DiLella, the Semiquincentennial Commission gave its federal funds and program responsibilities to another entity, the America250 Foundation, where Mr. DiLella also was chairman. Several commissioners questioned the legality of the arrangement and the number of Mr. DiLella\\'s friends and business associates who received contracts and positions of responsibility with America250. Mr. DiLella has denied wrongdoing and sued three fellow commissioners who criticized him for defamation, an allegation they deny. Mr. DiLella said the project turned the corner in 2021 when Joseph Daniels, former president of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, was hired as executive director of the America250 Foundation. Mr. Daniels scrapped much of the organization\\'s initial planning and brought in his own team, but turmoil continued, including a discrimination lawsuit filed by female former executives and complaints from some commissioners that Mr. DiLella was running the organization with excessive secrecy and doing little to advance its mission. America250 denied the allegations and hired the firm Constangy Brooks Smith & Prophete to review the claims. According to a three-page executive summary circulated internally in September, the review found \"workplace culture issues\" but didn\\'t support the allegations of systemic problems. \"Several witnesses noted the challenges that the infighting among the commission and the pending lawsuit have created, not only on the work that they do for the foundation, but on the morale of the staff,\" the review said. In June, Meta canceled a $10 million sponsorship deal , citing \"leadership dysfunction\" at America250. The following month, President Biden replaced Mr. DiLella as chairman with Ms. Rios, a longtime commission member who had been on Mr. DiLella\\'s leadership team. At the request of Sen. Robert Casey (D., Pa.), who represented Senate Democrats on the commission, some lawmakers last year set aside $1 million for the Interior Department inspector general to investigate the Semiquincentennial project. Commission officials lobbied to kill that inquiry, and it ultimately was struck from the budget. Mr. Casey then resigned from the commission. \"Sen. Casey has been proud to represent the birthplace of our nation on the Semiquincentennial Commission, but he is no longer able to commit the amount of time and attention that he believes the commission needs,\" a spokeswoman said. Ms. Rios said she has taken steps to reorganize the project, parting ways with Mr. Daniels over what she called \"differing philosophies\" and consolidating commission and foundation operations. Mr. Daniels declined to comment. \"I\\'m not going to let any issues distract my team or me from the work that we need to do to deliver the best commemoration of America\\'s anniversary that\\'s ever been done,\" Ms. Rios said. Write to Jess Bravin at Jess.Bravin@wsj.com'], ['Lyft Inc., grappling with competition and a battered stock price , is tapping a board member as its chief executive, and its two co-founders will step back from managing the company, the ride-sharing company said Monday. David Risher, who had management stints at Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. before starting a childhood-reading nonprofit in 2009, will take over from Logan Green, who co-founded Lyft with current President John Zimmer. The pair will retain their seats on the board but not participate in running Lyft day-to-day. Mr. Risher has been a Lyft board member since 2021. \"The macroeconomy is tough and the world is full of some uncertainty and that\\'s a real factor for sure and, then, when you zoom in one click, the competitive environment is tough. We have a very aggressive—very aggressive—competitor,\" Mr. Risher said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \"I think being a strong number two is a good place to be,\" he added. \"I like where we are, but we\\'ve got real work to do to fight it out a little bit.\" Lyft shares rose around 4% in after-hours trading Monday after the Journal reported the news. Lyft has struggled to keep up with its larger rival Uber Technologies Inc. Uber now commands 74% of the U.S. ride-share market, up from 62% in early 2020, according to consumer receipts analyzed by market-research firm YipitData. Lyft\\'s market share has fallen to 26% from 38% over the same period, YipitData shows. Uber, which has a global and more diversified business, leveraged its food-delivery operations to deal with a driver shortage that crippled the ride-share industry as the economy reopened in 2021. Lyft chose not to get into food delivery and operates within the U.S. and Canada. Uber moved more quickly than Lyft to attract drivers with bonuses and some new features, many of which Lyft later implemented. Lyft hasn\\'t reported an annual profit since its inception in 2012, but it has been trimming its losses. Last month, the company announced a weaker-than-expected revenue outlook for the current quarter. Late last year, the San Francisco-based company laid off more than 700 employees or 13% of staff and scaled back on other businesses, such as renting cars to customers, as it looked to weather a possible recession. Its stock has tumbled over 74% in the past 12 months. Uber\\'s shares have fallen around 10% over that period. Messrs. Zimmer and Green said in an interview that they were stepping down for personal reasons. Mr. Green, who has four children, said he approached the board about finding a successor after his 39th birthday late last year \"prompted some reflections in terms of what I want in life.\" Mr. Risher said he was approached for the job earlier this year. \"This recent decision to pass the torch to David feels really good,\" Mr. Zimmer said. \"There\\'s always things we could have done differently or better.\" One of the decisions that Mr. Green said he would reconsider was limiting Lyft\\'s business to North America. Uber spent its early years expanding overseas, from where it now gets about 40% of its revenue. There is \"still a lot of upside and a lot of room\" for international expansion, Mr. Green said. Mr. Risher wouldn\\'t say if he had plans to expand internationally. Mr. Green controls more than 20% of shareholder voting rights at the company. His interest in transportation was sparked by a stint in Zimbabwe as a college student when he noticed how carpooling was a popular option among neighbors and thought that there must be a better way to utilize all the empty car seats in the U.S. Mr. Zimmer worked at Lehman Brothers before giving that up to move to San Francisco to help launch the company which became Lyft. He has special shares that give him around 12% of the voting rights for the company. Mr. Zimmer said Monday that he had ferried passengers as a Lyft driver on New Year\\'s Eve for more than a decade. The new CEO, Mr. Risher, said he hopes to add to what the two have built. \"My real opportunity is to take that foundation and take it to the next level,\" Mr. Risher said. \"A new person can help bring in even new energy. That\\'s job one right now.\" Write to Preetika Rana at preetika.rana@wsj.com , Lauren Thomas at lauren.thomas@wsj.com and Emily Glazer at Emily.Glazer@wsj.com'], ['Some financial regulators appear to have seized on a series of high-profile meltdowns to go around Congress and try to freeze an entire industry out of banking services. I spent more than a decade as a federal prosecutor on some of the worst threats our country faces—organized crime, the opioid epidemic, political corruption and terrorism. In my final years at the Justice Department, I shifted to cases involving emerging technology, including the then-nascent crypto category, from the Mt. Gox hack to the corrupt Silk Road agents . Years later, the space continues to attract crime and fraud, but it has also drawn some of the brightest engineering talent in the world. Public blockchains, the foundational technology of the ecosystem, are an important set of tools that reflect breakthroughs in cryptography and distributed computing. In addition to early financial-use cases, this sector provides new ways to develop, monetize and govern all kinds of software. Unfortunately, members of this computing vanguard are being lumped in with the bad actors as part of a coordinated regulatory campaign to stymie progress in the sector. While other countries are putting in place laws and regulations, in the U.S. unelected officials are making major policy decisions about whether or not America should have a crypto industry. These efforts are misguided, reckless and potentially unconstitutional. Most important, they put America on the dangerous path of closing off the banking system to those disfavored by a particular administration. In January, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve issued a statement notifying financial institutions to be on alert for customers operating in the space, saying decentralized networks are \"highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.\" This ominous statement, coupled with seeming behind-the-scenes discouragement by their regulators, has led many banks to begin steering clear of almost any business touching blockchain technologies. In subsequent weeks, numerous banks shut their doors to this emerging sector, and regulators reportedly are conditioning sales of distressed banks on severing ties with the industry. A decade ago, in an effort called Operation Choke Point, the Justice Department, the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC tried to circumvent Congress using similar tactics—pressuring banks to cease business with specific industries , citing fraud prevention. Today, we are again seeing backroom tactics as a substitute for legislation, process and public regulation. Regardless of one\\'s position on the underlying issue, these significant policy decisions should be made in an open and transparent way. This extralegal crackdown initially might not concern observers whose impressions of crypto are rooted in headlines about bad actors and outright criminals. But as four senators pointed out in a recent letter to the Fed, the FDIC and the OCC: \"When the Bernie Madoff fraud was uncovered, regulators did not pressure banks to cut off access to other asset managers.\" The teams my firm works with are developing applications beyond financial services. One CEO is a former Green Beret whose company is building products to keep personal data safe using cryptography. Others include a serial entrepreneur creating developer tools for decentralized technologies, and a team building tax and compliance software for digital assets. Several Coinbase alumni are building products that help creators monetize digital content outside TikTok and Meta-owned Instagram. These aren\\'t scofflaws in cargo shorts committing theft. Whatever one believes about crypto (I realize many smart and reasonable people don\\'t yet see the potential or need), major U.S. policy decisions should be made by Congress and state legislatures, not by unelected officials. If financial regulators are concerned about specific risks and believe new rules are appropriate, then they should follow procedures, including public notice and comment. If legislation is needed, that\\'s up to Congress, but unelected officials shouldn\\'t try to destroy an industry by freezing it out of the banking system. Imagine if more than a century ago regulators had cut Ford and General Motors off from banking services because they considered automobiles too risky, or too competitive with trains and horses. In 1980, Massachusetts securities regulators barred citizens from buying stock in Apple\\'s IPO on the grounds that it was too \"risky.\" In the future, what if financial regulators were to warn banks against taking artificial-intelligence or alternative-energy customers because they\\'re too risky? And because of semiconductors we now know what happens when America fails to keep key industries onshore. Meanwhile, other countries are working on regulating digital assets through a public process. Just this month, the U.K. reaffirmed its commitment to provide a framework for consultation to regulate digital assets, and the EU recently introduced a harmonized set of rules for all 27 member countries. Singapore, Dubai and Japan are all establishing rules to provide clarity to the industry. Hong Kong is developing a crypto-licensing regime, with the apparent blessing of Beijing . If American lawmakers don\\'t provide a framework for decentralized technologies, then a major frontier of technological innovation will begin to move to more hospitable economies. America has long been a global leader in technology. Our regulators have risen to the occasion—not stifling innovation but embracing technological advances while maintaining a fair, honest and trusted playing field. But the expedient political view threatens to choke off innovation and punish legitimate actors. Every lawful business should have access to the banking system. Government censorship as a backdoor substitute for the legislative process has no place in finance—or any industry. Ms. Haun is CEO and founder of Haun Ventures, an investment firm specializing in decentralized technologies. She is a director of Coinbase and a former federal prosecutor.', \"Dark clouds hovering over the U.S. banking sector may have ironically created a silver lining for emerging economies in Asia—lower oil prices. That comes as the key growth driver for much of the region, China, is ramping back up. Usually that would mean higher energy prices too, and inflation. But this time energy-hungry emerging Asian economies appear poised to benefit from China's reopening when inflationary pressures are actually easing. A slowdown in developed world demand will still hit exports. But emerging Asia—especially Chinese-tourism dependent economies such as Thailand and Singapore—could end up as growth outperformers this year if oil prices stay low and China's reopening stays on track. Both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are still focused on curbing inflation: Both central banks delivered a 0.25-percentage-point hike last week despite U.S. bank failures and the distressed sale of Credit Suisse in Switzerland. But monetary tightening has already slowed or stopped in most emerging Asian economies, such as India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia. Brent crude oil prices have fallen 10% in the last three months, according to Refinitiv data, and about 38% from their peak last year. Food prices are falling too. A United Nations' index of food-commodity costs eased 0.6% in February from January, down for the 11th straight month. That combination of falling food and oil prices is especially important for many Asian emerging markets, since food and energy tend to be a bigger portion of inflation baskets in poorer economies, and key Asian EMs are big food or energy importers. That contrasts with Latin America, where agricultural heavyweights such as Brazil get a lift from rising soy or meat prices. At the same time, the sturm and drang in the U.S. banking sector, which has seen the failure of midsize lender Silicon Valley Bank and another bank in recent weeks, isn't likely to have much direct impact on Asian EMs. Goldman Sachs reckons that U.S. bank closures and the consequent likely tightening of U.S. lending standards matter for Asia only to the extent they slow U.S. or foreign demand growth. Australian bank ANZ thinks that even if U.S. growth eases, the impact on Asia will be offset by China's reopening—actually boosting its safe-haven appeal. To be sure, export oriented economies like Vietnam will take a hit if demand from advanced economies slows sharply. And oil prices could still bounce back, especially if China's industrial and construction sectors increase further in the second half of the year. But a repeat of 2008—and its global fallout—doesn't seem likely, at least for now. Emerging Asia is famous for its perennial monsoons, typhoons and other extreme weather. In 2023, parts of it might actually end up as a storm shelter instead.

Write to Jess Bravin at Jess.Bravin@wsj.com', 'HARSEWINKEL, Germany -- When Russia invaded Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin was counting on soaring energy prices and falling confidence to sink European companies, undermining the West\\'s support for Kyiv. One year later, many European companies have overcome the blow after slashing energy use and pivoting to a friendly and booming U.S. market. Such resilience has helped shore up political and popular support in Europe for Ukraine. Nowhere has the dynamic surprised as much as in Germany, a hub for energy-hungry manufacturers that had long relied on cheap supplies of Russian natural gas. Not only have German companies avoided the crash many economists predicted, but Berlin has also turned from relatively Kremlin-friendly into Kyiv\\'s third-biggest arms supplier. One of these companies is Claas KGaA mbH, a manufacturer of agricultural machinery with 5 billion euros of annual revenue, the equivalent of around $5.4 billion, and about 12,000 employees. When Moscow\\'s troops marched into Ukraine, Claas made about one quarter of its total sales in Central and Eastern Europe, including Russia. It has a large sales office in Ukraine and a plant in the Russian city of Krasnodar, 150 miles east of Crimea. Yet instead of retrenching, it cut production in Russia and China while increasing output at its main German factory by 30% last year. It reduced natural-gas consumption by almost one-third by making technical changes and has pivoted sales from Russia to the Americas. \"You look at what people and technical facilities you can use, and then you solve the problem,\" said Kai Gieselmann, a factory manager at Claas\\'s headquarters. Claas reported a 3% increase in annual output last year to almost 5 billion euros and a smaller, but healthy, profit. A 6% decline in sales in Central and Eastern Europe including Russia was more than offset by sales growth of 35% in the Americas. The changes wrought by Russia\\'s war \"won\\'t go away. One lesson is that we are somewhat maneuvering into a new normal,\" said Claas Chief Executive Thomas Bock. One of the biggest consequences of the Ukraine war for Claas was the redrawing of its global client map. The company still operates its Russian plant -- combine harvesters are exempt from sanctions, it says -- but has written off its investment there, valued at 40 million euros. As they scoured for alternative markets last year, executives settled on the Americas and especially the booming U.S. market. \"The market was there and the money was there,\" Mr. Bock said.', 'New York is poised to become the first state in the U.S. to pass a law banning natural-gas and other fossil-fuel hookups in new buildings, a step Democrats are pushing to help the state meet targets for greenhouse-gas reduction. The measure is on track to be added to the state\\'s coming budget, which is due to be completed this week. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in January pitched an all-electric building mandate in her spending plan, and both chambers of the Democratic-controlled State Legislature included similar proposals in their respective budget outlines. One of the legislation\\'s most noticeable effects would be an end to gas stoves in new homes, along with other gas-powered appliances such as water heaters, furnaces and clothes dryers. It faces opposition from some Republicans, labor unions, gas companies and business groups, citing concerns including affordability and reliability. Environmental groups have cheered the efforts. Democrats in Albany are still hammering out final details such as when the mandate would take effect, lawmakers said, though all proposals on the table take a phased-in approach. The suggested effective dates tossed around so far, for various kinds of buildings, range from as early as Jan. 1, 2025, to as late as Dec. 31, 2028. The Senate and Assembly measures would exempt uses such as commercial kitchens, hospitals, crematoriums, laboratories and laundromats, while the governor\\'s office said a range of exemptions would be possible. \"The basic premise here is that if you continue to build buildings that are going to require fossil fuels for decades to come, you are baking in. . .destructive behavior that burning fossil fuels causes,\" said Democratic state Sen. Brian Kavanagh, an advocate in the Senate. \"The first step is to stop digging the hole deeper.\" Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt said the proposals would remove options. \"Seeking a cleaner energy future does not have to involve outright prohibitions on reliable, affordable energy,\" he said. Controversy over gas stoves flared nationally earlier this year following a news report that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission was considering a gas-stove ban on indoor-air health concerns. Republicans and some centrist Democrats cast the Biden administration as trying to outlaw a beloved way of cooking. The White House said President Biden didn\\'t support a gas-stove ban. New Yorkers for Affordable Energy, a coalition that includes labor unions and gas companies, argues against a mandate, calling it unpopular with residents. A recent Siena College poll found that 53% of all New York respondents said they opposed the idea. \"Natural gas is going to continue to be part of the bridge between what we have now, with the heavy use of fossil fuel, and what we are going to have in the future,\" with more- renewable sources, said Daniel Ortega, of the coalition. \"Unless we are able to address reliability and affordability, none of this is going to work out.\" Under New York\\'s proposals for banning fossil-fuel hookups, people who already have gas stoves could keep them. Passage of a statewide building electrification requirement could spur other states to follow, said Amy Turner, senior fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. Dozens of U.S. municipalities already have all-electric building mandates, and lawmakers in some Republican-led states have passed laws blocking cities from imposing such requirements. \"This is going to be the biggest way we can chop off a huge amount of the pollution,\" said Assembly member Emily Gallagher, a Democrat who sponsored an all-electric building bill.', 'The economic fears gripping Wall Street have sparked outsize swings in oil prices, exacerbated by trading that investors and analysts say has little to do with the fundamental value of crude. One culprit is an arcane area of trading known on Wall Street as delta hedging, aimed at reducing the risks tied to directional price moves. This month, oil\\'s steepest weekly slide in almost three years accelerated as futures approached levels where many producers owned derivatives designed to lock in prices. As declines mounted, banks and trading firms on the other side of those trades had to unload crude to mitigate potential losses, investors said, dragging benchmark prices to 15-month lows. Now, many expect similar dynamics could add momentum to any rebound if the economic outlook improves -- leading to more expensive oil that could increase the cost of gasoline and diesel later this year. It is the latest example of how volatility in financial markets can spill into the real world, shaking an oil industry stretching from the shale basins of Texas to refineries in China. The recent retreat \"in many ways had not a lot to do with oil,\" said Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura Group, at an industry confab hosted by the Financial Times last week. \"We got caught up in the macro world again, which happens all the time. It\\'s OK,\" he added. \"But it distorts what happens in the future.\" In the coming week, investors will continue parsing the health of banks along with new readings on home prices, consumer confidence and the Federal Reserve\\'s preferred inflation gauge. A U.S. slowdown would eventually have big implications for crude and other commodities as well as stocks. Delta hedging revolves around a type of derivative known as put options, which are contracts granting their owner the right to sell oil or other investments at a specified price. For oil-and-gas producers such as EQT Corp. and Hess Corp., put options can function like a form of insurance, ensuring they can sell their output at a profit months in advance, even if prices fall. Banks and trading firms get paid premiums to sell puts. But the value of the options can rise -- saddling them with paper losses -- as crude approaches the \"strike\" price of the contracts. Traders can protect themselves either by buying puts of their own or by delta hedging, which in this case entails unloading crude futures. These types of trades can shake up all kinds of markets. When stocks endured bursts of volatility between long periods of calm in the years before the pandemic, some investors blamed hedging with derivatives. During the meme-stock craze, frenetic options trading in shares of companies such as GameStop Corp. and Tesla Inc. led to delta hedging that often amplified price swings in both directions. \"It\\'s not just volatility to the downside,\" said Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at Swiss bank UBS Group. Oil has traded this year within a relatively narrow price range as investors weigh resurgent demand in China against growing recession fears in the U.S. and Europe. Worries about the banking sector fueled a fresh round of selling Friday, sending benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude futures down 1% to $69.26 a barrel. At Hess, which pumps oil from projects including offshore rigs near the coast of Guyana, the hedging strategy includes put options that cover about 65% of the company\\'s projected crude output in 2023, a spokeswoman said. The New York-based company this year has bought contracts covering 80,000 barrels a day of U.S. crude output at $70 a barrel as well as 50,000 barrels a day of Brent, the global price gauge, at $75. \"Just like you have insurance in your home, you hope you never have to use it,\" said Hess Chief Financial Officer John Rielly, speaking at an investor conference this month. Crude prices recently began falling when stocks and bond yields dropped and algorithmic, trend-following trading programs began to sell oil futures, said Pierre Andurand, chief investment officer of Andurand Capital Management. His firm and other funds then sold some of the oil futures they owned to cut potential losses, he added. Options dealers were hedging puts on roughly 80 million barrels of crude oil with strike prices near $70 a barrel when oil dropped toward that level on March 15, according to Standard Chartered. As the possibility grew that financial institutions would need to pay out on those contracts, investors said those trading desks sold futures at an increasingly rapid clip. \"The more you do that, the lower the price goes and the more it pushes other people to do the same thing,\" said Ilia Bouchouev, managing partner at Pentathlon Investments. \"It\\'s a chain reaction.\" The moves accelerated a selloff that pulled the domestic crude benchmark to $66.74 a barrel by the close on March 17, a 13% week-on-week drop that was the sharpest such decline since the pandemic dragged U.S. crude below $0 in April 2020. Eventually, lower prices encouraged some bullish traders as well as oil consumers -- such as airlines -- to step in and buy. That propelled prices higher before Friday\\'s selloff eroded some of the gains. \"A lot of consumers were sitting on dry powder waiting for this move,\" said Brian Murphy, a derivatives broker at Tullett Prebon. Mr. Andurand, whose $1.3 billion hedge fund lost money in the recent rout, said his firm plans to rebuild its bullish position as energy markets stabilize. He is among the traders who think China\\'s appetite for oil will push prices up later this year, even as some analysts suggest that demand outside Asia is sluggish and global supplies are plentiful. Mr. Andurand believes oil prices could reach as high as $140 a barrel later this year. \"Demand will really surprise. . .in a significant way,\" he said.', 'ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance was only a budding oilman when he first set foot in Alaska. Nearly four decades later, his company reigns supreme over the U.S. Arctic. With most of its competitors abandoning the state, ConocoPhillips is forging ahead with drilling there, emboldened by President Biden\\'s approval this month of a robust, new project. At a time when investors profess gloomy views of long-term demand for oil and demand quick returns from companies, Mr. Lance\\'s contrarian strategy sets him apart. The CEO says that a dearth of investments in oil and gas means that the world will need new supplies of crude; as a result, he is pursuing a strategy to drill wells that will yield oil for decades. That plan is underpinned by ConocoPhillips investments in Alaska, where Mr. Lance\\'s career started. He spent around 14 years there navigating the state\\'s energy landscape, politics and, occasionally, its wildlife. An avid hunter and fisherman, Mr. Lance embraced the local lifestyle. The oil boss likes to tell people about the time he was hiking through the Kenai Mountains and crossed paths with a bear that chased him up a tree, said Don Wallette, a former chief financial officer at ConocoPhillips. People who know Mr. Lance said his experience in Alaska shaped his advocacy for the roughly $7 billion Willow project in the state\\'s North Slope, which Mr. Biden greenlighted earlier in March. Willow cements ConocoPhillips\\'s status as the largest producer in the state and gives it license to keep expanding, analysts said. Environmentalists argue Arctic drilling should be halted immediately to avoid a climate catastrophe. The project is expected to yield 180,000 oil barrels a day at its peak. \"These are larger-sized projects because we know the oil is going to be needed for decades,\" Mr. Lance said at the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference this month. While competitors Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. grab more headlines, Houston-based ConocoPhillips under Mr. Lance has quietly become one of the largest Western oil producers. The company\\'s market capitalization, hovering around $118 billion, now exceeds that of British giant BP PLC, which was one of the largest producers in Alaska before selling all of its assets there in 2019. Alaska has been a reliable cash provider for ConocoPhillips. Between 2012 and 2022, the company\\'s business there prospered to represent on average around a quarter of its annual profit, according to a Wall Street Journal review of regulatory filings. Mr. Lance, a Montana native, toiled away on drilling rigs in Wyoming to put himself through college and earn a petroleum engineering degree from Montana Tech University. When he failed to sign up for a job interview with oil company Atlantic Richfield Co., he brought a six-pack of Budweiser to the conference room where the recruiter was camping. He got an interview and nailed it, said Jerry Schuyler, the former recruiter and a confidant to Mr. Lance. Mr. Lance in 1984 joined Arco\\'s Alaska unit -- a company whose assets wound up in ConocoPhillips\\' portfolio. It was a strategic move: Alaska at the time provided roughly a fourth of U.S. crude production. Mr. Lance soon was promoted from a job handling oil field data to one overseeing drill sites -- a task that required interacting with regulatory agencies and legislators in the state, said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Houston-based Pickering Energy Partners and a former Arco engineer in Alaska. \"Ryan got experience being not just a champion of technical projects, but understanding how the system worked,\" he said. Mr. Lance eventually became vice president of Arco\\'s operations in the Western North Slope, part of a region that produces virtually all of Alaska\\'s oil. Phillips Petroleum Co.\\'s acquisition of Arco Alaska in 2000 catapulted him up the corporate ladder. After Phillips merged with Conoco Inc., he was promoted to international roles, before being appointed CEO of the combined entity in 2012. Under Mr. Lance, the company shrank its global presence, in part to prioritize assets generating the highest returns and augment returns to investors. But even as the company shed assets from Algeria to Kazakhstan, it kept nabbing leases and acquiring competitors\\' wells in Alaska. Major oil companies including BP and Shell PLC once also coveted Alaska\\'s oil riches. But regulatory challenges, combined with fruitless exploration efforts and the emergence of shale gushers from North Dakota to Texas refocused some drillers\\' attention away from the remote, capital-intensive Arctic, leaving ConocoPhillips ample room for new business. \"What we\\'re seeing in Alaska is a departure of the bigger companies,\" said Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who has supported Willow. \"Conoco has made a commitment, and they\\'re sticking by it.\" Willow has earned ConocoPhillips scorn from environmental groups, who say the project will emit climate-warming gases for decades. But it has found support among some Alaska Natives\\' associations and the Alaska delegation in Congress. Proponents say Willow could generate local, state and federal revenue of up to $17 billion and create jobs.'], ['Ukrainian officials called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Ukraine\\'s Foreign Ministry, in a written statement released Sunday, said moving the weapons to Belarus would undermine nuclear nonproliferation treaties . \"Ukraine expects effective actions to counter the nuclear blackmail of the Kremlin,\" the statement said, before calling on the other permanent members of the Security Council to intervene. \"We demand to immediately convene an extraordinary meeting of the U.N. Security Council for this purpose.\" Mr. Putin said in remarks published Saturday that Russia would finish building a storage facility for its tactical nuclear weapons—which are designed for battlefield use and aren\\'t large enough to wipe out entire cities—in Belarus by July. The announcement is the latest in a string of steps the Russian president has taken to remind Ukraine—and, more important, its allies—of Moscow\\'s nuclear capabilities . A spokesman for the White House said the administration is closely monitoring the issue but thus far hasn\\'t seen evidence that Mr. Putin had moved nuclear weapons or planned to use them in Ukraine. \"We would agree that no nuclear war should be fought, no nuclear war can be won, clearly that would cross a major threshold,\" John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said Sunday on CBS\\'s \"Face the Nation.\" He said, \"We\\'ve seen nothing that would cause us to change our own strategic deterrent posture.\" Poised to punch back Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko hasn\\'t publicly commented on the announcement, but Mr. Putin told a state television program on Sunday that the Belarusian leader has \"long raised the question of deploying Russian tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus.\" \"There is nothing unusual here either: Firstly, the United States has been doing this for decades,\" Mr. Putin added. \"They have long deployed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allied countries, NATO countries, in Europe.\" North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials rejected a parallel. \"Russia\\'s reference to NATO\\'s nuclear sharing is totally misleading,\" spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said on Twitter. She said NATO countries act in line with their international commitments, while \"Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments.\" Last summer, Mr. Lukashenko said his military\\'s Su-24 warplanes had been modified to carry nuclear weapons, a move that had been agreed upon with Mr. Putin, Belarusian state news agency Belta reported at the time. Western officials and analysts largely played down the significance of the announcement. Moscow has been using Belarus as a launchpad for assaults on Ukraine since the start of the invasion and has already sent Iskander-M missiles, which are nuclear-capable and can deliver a payload of over 500 kilograms to most of Ukraine\\'s territory, into the country. Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who supporters believe rightfully won the country\\'s 2020 presidential vote, said Saturday that Russia\\'s deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus violates the country\\'s constitution and contradicts the will of the Belarusian people to remain a non-nuclear state. \"Russia acts as the occupying force, violating national security and putting Belarus on the collision course with its neighbors and the international community,\" she wrote on Twitter. The German Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, accused Mr. Putin of \"another attempt at nuclear intimidation,\" according to German media. Josep Borrell, the European Union\\'s foreign policy chief, tweeted Sunday that \"Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation and threat to European security.\" He said the EU \"stands ready to respond with further sanctions,\" if Minsk follows this course of action. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said the announcement about stationing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus was part of an information campaign designed to inflame Western fears of nuclear escalation, \"which remains extremely low.\" \"Russia has long fielded nuclear-capable weapons able to strike any target that tactical nuclear weapons based in Belarus could hit,\" the institute wrote. \"Putin is a risk-averse actor who repeatedly threatens to use nuclear weapons without any intention of following through.\" Mr. Putin said Sunday that Russia would on April 3 start training crews to use tactical nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, the United Nations nuclear regulator, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Saturday that its director would again travel to inspect the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear-power plant this week. The visit would be his second since the start of the full-scale invasion last year. \"Despite our presence at the site for seven months now, the situation at the [Zaporizhzhia] Nuclear Power Plant is still precarious,\" the agency\\'s head, Rafael Grossi, said. \"The nuclear safety and security dangers are all too obvious.\" In addition, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Russia was being resupplied with Iranian-made Shahed drones . After a two-week pause in drone attacks in February, Moscow has launched 71 into Ukraine since the start of March. The drone attacks, launched from Russian territory, are \"likely to be a further attempt to stretch Ukrainian air defenses,\" the ministry wrote on Twitter. Meanwhile, Russia continued missile and artillery strikes across much of Ukraine over the weekend. All of the Ukrainian regions that border Russia were hit, as were the partially occupied regions in the south, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. Five civilians were killed and 25 others were injured. Russia\\'s Defense Ministry said Sunday that its troops were undertaking active operations in the areas of Kupyansk, in Ukraine\\'s northeast, Donetsk in the east, and Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south. Though fighting in and around the eastern city of Bakhmut has slowed in recent days, Ukraine\\'s armed forces said Russian forces \"continue to storm the city,\" while also targeting nearby settlements, such as Chasiv Yar, with artillery fire. —Gordon Lubold contributed to this article.

But it has found support among some Alaska Natives\\' associations, local politicians and the Alaska delegation in Congress. Proponents say that Willow could generate local, state and federal revenue of up to $17 billion and create more than 2,000 construction jobs and 300 permanent jobs. The project almost didn\\'t happen. In 2017, ConocoPhillips said it had found a trove of oil in Alaska\\'s National Petroleum Reserve, a 23-million-acre area managed by the U.S. Interior Department. But a federal judge in 2021 threw out the Bureau of Land Management\\'s approval of the proposed development, dubbed Willow, saying the agency had failed to fully account for the project\\'s environmental impact, and that the agency needed to conduct more studies. Among the options explored by the bureau to reduce Willow\\'s footprint was that its scale be brought down from five drill sites—the company\\'s initial plan—to three. ConocoPhillips made it clear that anything less than three pads wouldn\\'t make the project viable. Mr. Lance made sure the company didn\\'t bend on that point, people close to him said. Last year, as Mr. Lance made the case for Willow in earning calls, ConocoPhillips amped up its lobbying spending. The company shelled out nearly $8.7 million, according to OpenSecrets , a nonpartisan group that tracks political spending—more than what Exxon or Chevron disbursed that year. It listed continued advocacy for Willow among other issues it was lobbying for, according to quarterly lobbying reports. A spokesman for ConocoPhillips said it had increased its engagement with key stakeholders on a range of energy issues and other legislation, including Willow. Ultimately, Mr. Biden gave a down-to-the-wire approval of Willow over fierce objections from environmentalists and many Democrats who wanted the project scuttled. The company was cleared to build three pads. Environmental groups earlier this month sued the Biden administration to stop the project. ConocoPhillips has started building ice roads but agreed to pause some development until a federal judge has reviewed environmentalists\\' request to halt construction activities pending litigation, according to court filings. ConocoPhillips has said it doesn\\'t expect Willow to start churning out oil until around 2029. Those who know Mr. Lance say he believes his strategy will prevail. \"He believes in the long haul, the right answer will usually float to the surface,\" said Mr. Schuyler, the former Arco recruiter. Write to Benoît Morenne at benoit.morenne@wsj.com', 'New York is poised to become the first state in the U.S. to pass a law banning natural-gas and other fossil-fuel hookups in new buildings, a step Democrats are pushing to help the state meet targets for greenhouse-gas reduction . The measure is on track to be added to the state\\'s coming budget, which is due to be completed this week. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in January pitched an all-electric building mandate in her spending plan, and both chambers of the Democratic-controlled State Legislature included similar proposals in their respective budget outlines. One of the legislation\\'s most noticeable effects would be an end to gas stoves in new homes, along with other gas-powered appliances such as water heaters, furnaces and clothes dryers. It faces opposition from some Republicans, labor unions, gas companies and business groups, citing concerns including affordability and reliability. Environmental groups have cheered the efforts. Democrats in Albany are still hammering out final details such as when the mandate would take effect, lawmakers said, though all proposals on the table take a phased-in approach. The suggested effective dates tossed around so far, for various kinds of buildings, range from as early as Jan. 1, 2025, to as late as Dec. 31, 2028. The Senate and Assembly measures would exempt uses such as commercial kitchens, hospitals, crematoriums, laboratories and laundromats, while the governor\\'s office said a range of exemptions would be possible. \"The basic premise here is that if you continue to build buildings that are going to require fossil fuels for decades to come, you are baking in…destructive behavior that burning fossil fuels causes,\" said Democratic state Sen. Brian Kavanagh, an advocate in the Senate. \"The first step is to stop digging the hole deeper.\" Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt said the proposals would remove options for consumers. \"Seeking a cleaner energy future does not have to involve outright prohibitions on reliable, affordable energy,\" he said. Controversy over gas stoves flared nationally earlier this year following a news report that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission was considering a gas-stove ban on indoor- air health concerns . Republicans and some centrist Democrats cast the Biden administration as trying to outlaw a beloved way of cooking. The White House said President Biden didn\\'t support a gas-stove ban. New Yorkers for Affordable Energy, a coalition that includes labor unions and gas companies, argues against a mandate, calling it unpopular with residents. A recent Siena College poll found that 53% of all New York respondents said they opposed the idea. \"Natural gas is going to continue to be part of the bridge between what we have now, with the heavy use of fossil fuel, and what we are going to have in the future,\" with more- renewable sources, said Daniel Ortega, of the coalition. \"Unless we are able to address reliability and affordability, none of this is going to work out.\" He cited December\\'s blizzard in Buffalo that caused widespread power outages as an illustration of electricity\\'s limitations. Mr. Kavanagh, who represents lower Manhattan, said the Senate bill allows backup power sources using fossil fuels, and added that modern buildings often have battery-storage capacity. Under New York\\'s proposals for banning fossil-fuel hookups, people who already have gas stoves could keep them. That would also be true under a separate proposal from Ms. Hochul to prohibit the sale of any new fossil-fuel heating equipment and related systems for existing homes and buildings starting in 2030. Passage of a statewide building electrification requirement could spur other states to follow, said Amy Turner, senior fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. \"New York state is a big place. Parts of it are politically purple to red. It has areas of very cold climate,\" she said. Dozens of U.S. municipalities, including many Democratic-led cities in California and elsewhere, already have all-electric building mandates, and lawmakers in some Republican-led states have passed laws blocking cities from imposing such requirements. In late 2021, New York City mandated that most new buildings be constructed fully electric. Some states have pursued similar goals without legislation. Last year the Washington State Building Code Council moved to require heat pumps as the main heating source in buildings. The changes, which take effect in July, allow gas heat pumps and the use of gas supplemental heating. The New York state Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, passed in 2019, calls for a reduction in economywide greenhouse-gas emissions of 40% by 2030 and 85% by 2050 from 1990 levels. \"This is going to be the biggest way we can chop off a huge amount of the pollution,\" said Assembly member Emily Gallagher, a Democrat who sponsored an all-electric building bill. Write to Scott Calvert at scott.calvert@wsj.com', 'The economic fears gripping Wall Street have sparked outsize swings in oil prices, exacerbated by trading that investors and analysts say has little to do with the fundamental value of crude. One culprit is an arcane area of trading known on Wall Street as delta hedging, aimed at reducing the risks tied to directional price moves. Earlier this month, oil\\'s steepest weekly slide in almost three years accelerated as futures approached levels where many producers owned derivatives designed to lock in prices. As declines mounted, banks and trading firms on the other side of those trades had to unload crude to mitigate potential losses, investors said, dragging benchmark prices to 15-month lows. Now, many expect similar dynamics could add momentum to any rebound if the economic outlook improves—leading to more expensive oil that could increase the cost of gasoline and diesel later this year. It is the latest example of how volatility in financial markets can spill into the real world, shaking an oil industry stretching from the shale basins of Texas to refineries in China. The recent retreat \"in many ways had not a lot to do with oil,\" said Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura Group, at an industry confab hosted by the Financial Times last week. \"We got caught up in the macro world again, which happens all the time. It\\'s OK,\" he added. \"But it distorts what happens in the future.\" In the coming week, investors will continue parsing the health of banks, along with new readings on home prices, consumer confidence and the Federal Reserve\\'s preferred inflation gauge. A U.S. slowdown would eventually have big implications for crude and other commodities, as well as stocks. Delta hedging revolves around a type of derivative known as put options, which are contracts granting their owner the right to sell oil or other investments at a specified price. For oil-and-gas producers such as EQT Corp. and Hess Corp., put options can function like a form of insurance, ensuring they can sell their output at a profit months in advance, even if prices fall. Banks and trading firms get paid premiums to sell puts. But the value of the options can rise—saddling them with paper losses—as crude approaches the \"strike\" price of the contracts. Traders can protect themselves either by buying puts of their own, or by delta hedging, which in this case entails unloading crude futures. These types of trades can shake up all kinds of markets. When stocks endured bursts of volatility between long periods of calm in the years before the pandemic, some investors said hedging with derivatives was to blame . During the meme-stock craze, frenetic options trading in shares of companies such as GameStop Corp. and Tesla Inc. led to delta hedging that often amplified price swings in both directions. \"It\\'s not just volatility to the downside,\" said Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at Swiss bank UBS Group. Oil has traded this year within a relatively narrow price range as investors weigh resurgent demand in China against growing recession fears in the U.S. and Europe. Worries about the banking sector fueled a fresh round of selling Friday, sending benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude futures down 1% to $69.26 a barrel. At Hess, which pumps oil from projects including offshore rigs near the coast of Guyana, the hedging strategy includes put options that cover about 65% of the company\\'s projected crude output in 2023, a spokeswoman said. The New York-based company this year has bought contracts covering 80,000 barrels a day of U.S. crude output at $70 a barrel, as well as 50,000 barrels a day of Brent, the global price gauge, at $75. \"Just like you have insurance in your home, you hope you never have to use it,\" said Hess Chief Financial Officer John Rielly, speaking at an investor conference this month. Crude prices recently began falling when stocks and bond yields dropped and algorithmic, trend-following trading programs began to sell oil futures, said Pierre Andurand, chief investment officer of Andurand Capital Management. His firm and other funds then sold some of the oil futures they owned to cut potential losses, he added. Options dealers were hedging puts on roughly 80 million barrels of crude oil with strike prices near $70 a barrel when oil dropped toward that level on March 15, according to Standard Chartered. As the possibility grew that financial institutions would need to pay out on those contracts, investors said those trading desks sold futures at an increasingly rapid clip. \"The more you do that, the lower the price goes and the more it pushes other people to do the same thing,\" said Ilia Bouchouev, managing partner at Pentathlon Investments. \"It\\'s a chain reaction.\" The moves accelerated a selloff that pulled the domestic crude benchmark to $66.74 a barrel by the close on March 17, a 13% week-on-week drop that was the sharpest such decline since the pandemic dragged U.S. crude below $0 in April 2020 . Eventually, lower prices encouraged some bullish traders as well as oil consumers—such as airlines—to step in and buy. That propelled prices higher before Friday\\'s selloff eroded some of the gains. \"A lot of consumers were sitting on dry powder waiting for this move,\" said Brian Murphy, a derivatives broker at Tullett Prebon. Mr. Andurand, whose $1.3 billion hedge fund lost money in the recent rout, said his firm plans to rebuild its bullish position as energy markets stabilize. He is among the traders who think China\\'s appetite for oil will push prices up later this year, even as some analysts suggest that demand outside Asia is sluggish and global supplies are plentiful. Chinese refiners have recently snapped up supertanker shipments of oil in a sign that China\\'s long-awaited recovery from pandemic lockdowns is finally beginning to take hold. Citing mobility data in China and the restart of international flights in and out of the country, Mr. Andurand believes oil prices could reach as high as $140 a barrel later this year. \"Demand will really surprise…in a significant way,\" he said.

Mr. Fain, a 54-year-old who started his career as an electrician and rose through the UAW ranks while working at factories now owned by Stellantis NV, has struck a more strident tone ahead of negotiations later this year. His reform group has vowed to not give any concessions to the car companies and raised the possibility of a strike when contracts expire this fall. \"Today we put the companies on notice. The fighting UAW is back,\" Mr. Fain said in a video address after his victory. Mr. Fain declared victory on Saturday, narrowly defeating incumbent Ray Curry, who issued a statement saying Mr. Fain would be sworn in as president on Sunday. It is the first time in more than 70 years that a challenger defeated a presidential candidate from the UAW\\'s longtime ruling party. The office of the federal monitor overseeing the election filed the final tally to a U.S. District Court in Michigan on Saturday. Those results, which had Mr. Fain winning 69,459 to 68,976, aren\\'t considered certified until all election-related challenges are resolved. The election of Mr. Fain is a turning point for the UAW, which represents more than 400,000 workers in the automotive sector and other industries and is emerging from a yearslong corruption scandal . His campaign vowed to root out any residual corruption, while also taking the toughest stance against auto makers of any union leadership since the 1940s. \"This election was not just a race between two candidates, it was a referendum on the direction of the UAW,\" Mr. Fain said in a statement. The UAW represents roughly 145,000 hourly members at U.S. factories owned by General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Ram, Chrysler and other U.S.-sold brands. The coming negotiations, which occur every four years, are set to begin this summer ahead of the expiration of the current labor contracts in September. Mr. Fain\\'s victory heightens the chance of a UAW strike at one of the auto makers, Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan wrote in a recent research note. \"The new reform candidates have less national bargaining experience and are promising an aggressive stance,\" he said. This year\\'s round of collective bargaining was already setting up to be particularly contentious, with potential flashpoints over wages, high inflation and job security as the auto makers switch to electric vehicles . Meanwhile, the companies are in belt-tightening mode. GM recently said it plans to cut $2 billion in costs by next year and this month offered voluntary buyouts to most of its roughly 58,000 white-collar U.S. workers. Ford cut about 3,000 white-collar jobs and contract positions last year. The union vote resulted from a shift in the way the UAW selects top officials. Historically, leaders of the union\\'s local chapters elected the UAW\\'s top officers. In late 2021, the union\\'s rank-and-file voted to change the election procedure to allow members to directly cast ballots to pick their leaders. The vote on the election change was required under terms of a civil settlement between the Justice Department and the UAW in 2020, following a multiyear federal investigation that led to the convictions of more than a dozen top UAW officials, including two former presidents . The corruption scandal eroded members\\' trust in the UAW\\'s leadership, factory workers have said, and provided momentum to Mr. Fain and his reform group. Federal prosecutors, in filing charges against prior union leaders, described a culture of corruption that included kickback schemes, embezzlement and other illicit activities. Under terms of the settlement, a federal monitor oversees the union\\'s finances and other activities, including the recent election. Mr. Fain and the other candidates on his reform-minded UAW Members United slate have said they want to unify a divided membership, ensure equal pay and benefits for workers at varying levels of the union and increase the value of retirees\\' pensions. \"The UAW officers, the people elected to lead and serve this great union have taken bribes, stolen dues and betrayed the trust of the membership. That ends here,\" Mr. Fain said in the Saturday video address. Mr. Fain faces a divided executive board, about half of which is filled by his caucus. The broader membership, too, is divided, based on Mr. Fain\\'s narrow victory margin, said Marick Masters, a professor of business with a focus on labor at Wayne State University in Detroit. \"You have an opportunity now to see the extent to which rank-and-file may be dissatisfied with the current leadership,\" he said. Mr. Fain has been involved in contract negotiations both at the national level and at Chrysler Corp. factories, now owned by Stellantis, according to his group\\'s website. As the auto industry develops more electric vehicles, which are less labor-intensive to produce than internal-combustion-engine cars, preserving manufacturing jobs in gas-engine plants will be a focus of the UAW, leaders have said. Late last year, Stellantis stopped operations at a 1,350-employee assembly plant in Illinois, citing the expensive EV transition as one reason it needed to cut costs. The UAW\\'s last round of collective bargaining for a four-year contract in 2019 resulted in a 40-day strike at GM\\'s U.S. factories, which drained more than $3 billion from the company\\'s bottom line. The coming contract negotiations will be unfolding in a different economic and social environment from the 2019 talks. Rising inflation has eroded workers\\' spending power, while organized labor in the U.S. has been reinvigorated in recent years.

Write to Nora Eckert at nora.eckert@wsj.com'], ['The United Auto Workers elected reform candidate Shawn Fain as its next leader, according to Mr. Fain and his opponent, marking an upheaval in the union\\'s top ranks and creating a wild card for auto makers ahead of contract talks in Detroit. Mr. Fain, a 54-year-old who started his career as an electrician and rose through the UAW ranks while working at factories now owned by Stellantis NV, has struck a more strident tone ahead of negotiations later this year. His reform group has vowed to not give any concessions to the car companies and raised the possibility of a strike when contracts expire this fall. Mr. Fain declared victory on Saturday, narrowly defeating incumbent Ray Curry, who issued a statement saying Mr. Fain would be sworn in as president on Sunday. It is the first time in more than 70 years that a challenger defeated a presidential candidate from the UAW\\'s longtime ruling party. The office of the federal monitor overseeing the election filed the final tally to a U.S. District Court in Michigan on Saturday. Those results, which had Mr. Fain winning 69,459 to 68,976, aren\\'t considered certified until all election-related challenges are resolved. The election of Mr. Fain is a turning point for the UAW, which represents more than 400,000 workers in the automotive sector and other industries and is emerging from a yearslong corruption scandal . His campaign vowed to root out any residual corruption, while also taking the toughest stance against auto makers of any union leadership since the 1940s. \"Everything we do, at every stage, must be reinforcing the message: there is a new sheriff in town,\" said a draft transition-plan document from early February that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal and verified by the Fain campaign. The UAW represents roughly 145,000 hourly members at U.S. factories owned by General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Ram, Chrysler and other U.S.-sold brands. The coming negotiations, which occur every four years, are set to begin this summer ahead of the expiration of the current labor contracts in September. Mr. Fain\\'s victory heightens the chance of a UAW strike at one of the auto makers, Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan wrote in a recent research note. \"The new reform candidates have less national bargaining experience and are promising an aggressive stance,\" he said. In a statement sent earlier this week, the Fain campaign said: \"We need to take a new approach to the companies, and a new approach to how our union operates.\" This year\\'s round of collective bargaining was already setting up to be particularly contentious, with potential flashpoints over wages, high inflation and job security as the auto makers switch to electric vehicles . Meanwhile, the companies are in belt-tightening mode. GM recently said it plans to cut $2 billion in costs by next year and this month offered voluntary buyouts to most of its roughly 58,000 white-collar U.S. workers. Ford cut about 3,000 white-collar jobs and contract positions last year. The union vote resulted from a shift in the way the UAW selects top officials. Historically, leaders of the union\\'s local chapters elected the UAW\\'s top officers. In late 2021, the union\\'s rank-and-file voted to change the election procedure to allow members to directly cast ballots to pick their leaders. The vote on the election change was required under terms of a civil settlement between the Justice Department and the UAW in 2020, following a multiyear federal investigation that led to the convictions of more than a dozen top UAW officials, including two former presidents . The corruption scandal eroded members\\' trust in the UAW\\'s leadership, factory workers have said, and provided momentum to Mr. Fain and his reform group. Federal prosecutors, in filing charges against prior union leaders, described a culture of corruption that included kickback schemes, embezzlement and other illicit activities. Under terms of the settlement, a federal monitor oversees the union\\'s finances and other activities, including the recent election. Mr. Fain and the other candidates on his reform-minded UAW Members United slate have said they want to unify a divided membership, ensure equal pay and benefits for workers at varying levels of the union and increase the value of retirees\\' pensions.

Write to Nora Eckert at nora.eckert@wsj.com', 'TEHRAN—Iran\\'s move to reset diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia was a radical break from years of enmity between the two Middle East rivals, but it hasn\\'t been enough to prop up its struggling economy. Before China stepped in to broker the deal earlier this month, Iran\\'s currency, the rial , had lost a fifth of its value over the last two weeks of February to hit a record low, adding to the problems besetting the ruling clerics here. Inflation was already rising, hitting 59% late last year, and talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal and get some relief from U.S. sanctions were all but dead. European powers had given up on a separate mechanism to transfer funds to Iran for humanitarian aid. Prisoner-swap negotiations with the U.S. weren\\'t progressing either, keeping billions of dollars in overseas bank accounts out of reach. The Americans had also begun cracking down on flows of hard currency from neighboring Iraq , removing an important pressure valve. \"The economic situation is a major part of why right now the Iranians decided to make this de-escalation agreement with the Saudis,\" said Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at Washington\\'s Middle East Institute. But while news of the deal helped ease the strain on the rial in the short term, pushing it off its historic low of more than 600,000 to the dollar, the currency has since lost value as the reality sinks in that, even with the Saudi deal, the country has few prospects for a turnaround unless it can escape sanctions over its nuclear program or build closer economic ties with China and Russia. \"It\\'s a thin market that lives and dies on headlines—and the headlines have been good the past few weeks,\" said Henry Rome, a senior fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. But, he said, \"inflation, especially food, is very high and rising, and the government is doing little to reel it in.\" The approach of Nowruz—the two-week Persian New Year holiday that began Monday—was a flashpoint. Middle-class Iranians found themselves with much diminished purchasing power for the rice, meat and other ingredients for the holiday\\'s feasts, and retired teachers, social-security officials and military personnel were protesting economic conditions across the country. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged the scope of the problems in a speech Tuesday marking Nowruz. \"If, God willing, we are able to reduce the economic problems and if, God willing, our officials make an effort, practice diligence and work hard on important tasks in this field, many of the country\\'s other problems will also be solved,\" Mr. Khamenei said, according to the state-run news agency IRNA. Iran\\'s clerical leaders have promised to tackle inflation before without success. When Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi took office in 2021 he vowed to reduce inflation to below 15% in 2023 and to single digits in 2024, but prices have only escalated, raising pressure on the government. Inflation remains rampant at more than 50%, with the cost of meat rising by 90% over the past year, according to the semiofficial ISNA news agency. When reformist newspaper Sazandegi reported about rising anger about food prices with a dramatic front-page headline, \"Meat Rebellion,\" on Feb. 20, it was immediately shut down. Ordinary Iranians say they have had trouble affording the ingredients to prepare Nowruz meals this week. \"We have become numb against inflation,\" said Alireza Babaie, a home-appliances salesman. \"We don\\'t feel anything anymore.\" Economists and traders say Saudi Arabia and Iran\\'s other neighbors are unlikely to pour significant amounts of cash into the Islamic Republic despite Tehran\\'s restoring diplomatic ties with Riyadh. Western sanctions remain a powerful deterrent. They also say Saudi Arabia would want to see if Tehran holds up its end of the deal by halting covert weapons shipments to its Houthi allies in Yemen , where Iran and Saudi Arabia had been fighting a proxy war. The resumption of diplomatic relations would help broaden political and economic cooperation in the region, Iranian Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said after the China-brokered deal was signed. There are some positive signs for Iran, chiefly its growing involvement with China, which increasingly is positioning itself as a global diplomatic counterpoint to the U.S. Beijing\\'s role in facilitating the deal between the two Middle East rivals signals that it intends to continue buying oil from both Saudi Arabia and Iran, ensuring Tehran a continuing economic lifeline, said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, chief executive officer of Bourse and Bazaar, a London-based think tank that studies the Iranian economy. Iran also has a growing military relationship with Russia, supplying drones for use in its war in Ukraine , and it is trying to expand other trade flows with Moscow. It is also negotiating with the West to retrieve some oil-revenue funds locked in countries such as South Korea, though with little success. Besides these relationships and the improvement in the relationship with Saudi Arabia, Iran has few other options to alleviate its problems and improve the prospects for its 88 million people. In January, the World Bank predicted its economy would grow 2.2% this year and by 1.9% in 2024—less than it needs to put it back on a sustainable long-term growth track. Crucially, the government is now finding it harder to maintain subsidies for food and energy and can\\'t afford to increase wages for civil servants. \"Tehran doesn\\'t have a lot of financial firepower to try to address these problems,\" Mr. Batmanghelidj said. Nor will closer ties to heavyweights such as China and Saudi Arabia make up for years of mismanagement and sanctions, said Mostafa Pakzad, a Tehran-based adviser to foreign companies. \"The Saudi deal releases a bit of oxygen for the regime not to suffocate,\" he said. Write to Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com and David S. Cloud at david.cloud@wsj.com', 'HARSEWINKEL, Germany—When Russia invaded Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin was counting on soaring energy prices and falling confidence to sink European companies, undermining the West\\'s support for Kyiv. One year on, many European companies have overcome the blow after slashing energy use and pivoting to a friendly and booming U.S. market. Such resilience has helped shore up political and popular support in Europe for Ukraine. Nowhere has the dynamic surprised as much as in Germany, a hub for energy-hungry manufacturers that had long relied on cheap supplies of Russian natural gas . Not only have German companies avoided the crash many economists predicted, but Berlin has also turned from relatively Kremlin-friendly into Kyiv\\'s third-biggest arms supplier. One of these companies is Claas KGaA mbH, a manufacturer of agricultural machinery with 5 billion euros of annual revenue, the equivalent of around $5.4 billion, and about 12,000 employees. When Moscow\\'s troops marched into Ukraine, Claas made about one quarter of its total sales in Central and Eastern Europe, including Russia. It has a large sales office in Ukraine and a plant in the Russian city of Krasnodar, 150 miles east of Crimea. Yet instead of retrenching, it cut production in Russia and China while increasing output at its main German factory by 30% last year. It reduced natural-gas consumption by almost one-third by making technical changes and has pivoted sales from Russia to the Americas. \"You look at what people and technical facilities you can use, and then you solve the problem,\" said Kai Gieselmann, a factory manager at Claas\\'s headquarters. Claas reported a 3% increase in annual output last year to almost €5 billion and a smaller but healthy profit. A 6% decline in sales in Central and Eastern Europe including Russia was more than offset by sales growth of 35% in the Americas. The changes wrought by Russia\\'s war \"won\\'t go away. One lesson is that we are somewhat maneuvering into a new normal,\" said Claas Chief Executive Thomas Böck. Claas\\'s pivot started on the morning of Russia\\'s invasion, on Feb. 24, 2022. That day, Mr. Böck was woken at 4 a.m. by a call from one of his managers. \"People were really under attack, you could hear bombs falling, on the phone,\" he said. His immediate problem was to reshuffle operations in Ukraine and Russia. The company\\'s top officials assembled in offices adjacent to its factory in the West German town of Harsewinkel, known officially as \"combine harvester city.\" Claas sourced key parts in Russia and Ukraine, including gears and large metal components. Executives fretted about whether they would be able to receive payments from Russia and if they would have enough cash to shore up their supply chain. Then as Moscow began throttling natural-gas supplies to Europe came another question: \"What does this mean for energy?\" said Henner Böttcher, the company\\'s chief financial officer. Claas executives said they used game theory to figure out how Berlin would ration fuel that millions of households rely on for heating—if it came to that—and figured that the company wouldn\\'t be shut off because of its proximity to Europe\\'s gas hub in the Netherlands. Still, the executives had to develop a contingency plan that would allow the company to survive a 30% decline in gas supplies. At its core was the decision to refit furnaces and heating systems so that they could run on oil as well as gas, including by installing new pipes. To keep the refitted furnaces humming, Claas bought and stored two million liters of oil on site. It also spent €300,000 to build liquefied-petroleum gas tanks and signed a supply contract for LPG delivery, which arrives by truck from the Netherlands. As gas prices surged to almost 20 times their 2021 levels, energy-hungry producers of critical components were coming under pressure across Germany, reducing production. For Claas, that created shortages of products such as gearboxes and rubber tractor tires, which compounded pandemic-era bottlenecks for components like microchips. The company developed software to keep abreast of problems at its hundreds of suppliers, using data to make long-term forecasts about where shortages might emerge. Senior managers meet daily on the factory floor, at 9:45 a.m., to check on supplies and identify potential bottlenecks, said Mr. Gieselmann. \"There are 240,000 parts in the combine harvester and I feel like I know every one,\" said Mr. Böttcher. His supplies task force meets at 7 a.m. every day, with procurement managers looking at how many parts are missing. To cut its energy bill, the company made simple changes—switching lightbulbs for LEDs, turning down the heating and eliminating warm water in some washrooms, plus some more complex ones. Workers in Claas\\'s paint shop found a way to lower the temperature of treating metals before they are painted by changing the chemicals in the vats. That reduced the temperature needed for the process from 95 degrees Fahrenheit to 68 degrees, room temperature. On the factory floor, three energy scouts constantly look for new ways to curb use. Digital counters around the factory show how much energy is being consumed. Employees are motivated to find small savings by being rewarded with a share of the money. One recent suggestion: Two similar metal parts were adapted so that only one part would be needed. A machine now recycles heat from the bench where combines\\' engines are tested, and uses it to heat the air in the factory. That saves 90% of energy costs in that step of the production process. Compounded across Germany, such efforts added up, slashing the country\\'s energy consumption by around one-quarter, according to data by the German energy regulator. To address parts shortages, Claas managers stepped into the market directly to support smaller suppliers, using the company\\'s clout as a big customer or tapping its contact books to source parts such as microchips. Sometimes, these effort involved resorting to unconventional fixes. Claas welded parts for one Dutch supplier at its German factory before shipping them back to the Netherlands. Its board members flew around the world to twist arms and loosen supply-chain blockages. One purchasing manager snapped up parts for a supplier on his personal credit card at the weekend. \"Everything is based on a long-term relationship,\" said Mr. Böck. One of the biggest consequences of the Ukraine war for Claas was the redrawing of its global client map. The company still operates its Russian plant—combine harvesters are exempt from sanctions, it says—but has written off its investment there, valued at €40 million. As they scoured for alternative markets last year, executives settled on the Americas and especially the booming U.S. market. \"The market was there and the money was there,\" Mr. Böck said. U.S. farmers could still benefit from Trump administration subsidies, while the strong dollar allowed Claas to offer low prices compared with local competitors, a spokesman said. Claas has a factory in Omaha, Neb., and its largest combine harvester model, the Lexion, won the \"Coolest German Thing Made in the U.S.A.\" Award in October, presented by the German-American Chambers of Commerce. Claas\\'s global supply chain also looks very different from a year ago. The company moved processes such as welding out of China and back to Harsewinkel. Economists say a number of German businesses have reshored production from China to Germany in recent years, in part to avoid U.S. tariffs, while others have transferred assets to countries politically allied with the West in a practice often referred to as friendshoring. Instead of Russia, Claas now buys parts for combine harvesters and telescopic handlers, which are similar to forklifts, in Eastern Europe and Germany, and large pre-assembled metal components in the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania. Claas\\'s German factories still run mostly on gas, but it is sourced from friendly countries such as the U.K. and Norway. Wholesale gas prices appear to be settling at about double the average level over the last decade and are expected to remain higher than other regions such as the U.S. Despite all the changes, Claas wasn\\'t left entirely unscathed. Some of its processes are now costlier, which has eaten into its profitability and dented its competitiveness, executives say. Mr. Böttcher, the CFO, said the company now has significantly lower margins than competitors in the U.S. and Japan. \"The export model is robust, but in a different form,\" said Mr. Böck, the CEO. The lesson of the past few years, he says: \"Don\\'t be dependent on one country.\" Write to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com', 'Manipulation of earnings from Corporate America is on the rise, an ominous omen for the U.S. economy. That is the conclusion of new research on accounting fraud, using a technique that flagged Enron as an earnings manipulator several years before the energy company\\'s spectacular 2001 implosion. Unless you study accounting, you have likely never come across the M-Score, which is the number underlying both the Enron episode and the economywide concern now. The \"M\" is for manipulation, and uses a company\\'s financial statements to determine whether it is engaging in manipulation. Since the 1990s, the metric has been used to identify red flags at individual companies. Now Messod D. Beneish, a professor of accounting at Indiana University who developed the M-Score in the 1990s, and several co-authors have calculated an aggregate score for nearly 2,000 companies. It shows a disturbing pattern in the historical data: The probability of manipulation usually rises rapidly in the quarters before the economy tips into recession. \"We think this is a measure of misinformation in the economy,\" said Dr. Beneish. The new aggregate measure was published in a December paper, and the latest data -- compiled in March and shared with The Wall Street Journal -- shows that the collective probability of fraud across major companies is the highest in over 40 years. The M-Score is calculated from eight ratios on a company\\'s balance sheet, all numbers that public companies report quarterly, and comparing the ratios to earnings statements from a year earlier. For example, one of the eight metrics raises a flag if a company abruptly starts reporting more \"receivables,\" that is, more money owed to the firm but not yet paid. Another flag goes up if a company reports higher values of assets that cannot be sold, and that aren\\'t clearly identified as plants, property or equipment. A third looks at changes in accruals, which is when an expense has been incurred, but not yet paid. Another identifies whether companies change how much depreciation they take. There are ways for companies to manipulate all these metrics to appear profitable even when actual sales aren\\'t improving. Of course, there could be legitimate reasons for any of these. A customer might have placed a large order toward the end of the quarter, yet won\\'t pay until early in the next quarter. A drug company might have purchased a major patent, which isn\\'t easily sold. It isn\\'t a factory, but it is genuinely very valuable. But collectively, if these metrics are moving in the wrong direction, it suggests funny business. The M-Score\\'s most famous moment came when it was revealed that three years before Enron\\'s collapse, a group of students at Cornell University\\'s business school, under accounting professor Charles Lee, used Dr. Beneish\\'s model to flag that Enron \"may be a company manipulating its earnings.\" Though their report was posted online, it received little attention until after Enron\\'s collapse. The model also flagged the German payment-processor Wirecard AG. Its spectacular collapse after accounting fraud was exposed in 2020 drew comparisons with Enron. Dr. Lee, now a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, says that any of the eight metrics wouldn\\'t necessarily mean trouble. But when the score of the combined metrics is rising, it shows \"a growth company, with core businesses that are eroding, that is running out of economic steam and using aggressive accounting,\" he said. Even if the accounting is legitimate, he added, \"you may want to avoid that company.\" Similar scores have been popular in accounting since the late 1960s. There is the Altman Z-score, created in 1968 by Edward Altman, for predicting whether companies are at risk of bankruptcy, and the Dechow F-Score, from the University of Southern California\\'s Patricia Dechow, designed to predict accounting misstatements. Models such as the M-Score aren\\'t necessarily smoking guns. They will sometimes flag legitimate businesses, especially with mergers and acquisitions. Strange shifts occur when companies absorb each other. They are, though, a reason to look more closely. \"You cannot take it to court and say, \\'Look, this company has a big M-Score and must be a fraud,\\'\" said Dr. Lee. \"But statistically, this fits the profile of a manipulator.\" In aggregate, when more firms are reporting sales that haven\\'t actually been completed, declining asset quality or any of the other indicators, it likely indicates that something in the economy is beginning to go wrong. And there is no shortage of signs of strain in the economy right now. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, several high-profile banks have collapsed, manufacturing activity has slowed and home prices are declining. Still, there is reason to think that the M-Score has something to add to the traditional numbers used to take stock of economic activity. False information on balance sheets has \"real economic effects because it represents misinformation on which firms base their investment, hiring, and production decisions,\" Dr. Beneish and his co-authors -- David Farber of Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis and Matthew Glendening and Kenneth Shaw, both of the University of Missouri -- wrote in December. The theory is that their index might be catching distress in the stages when some companies are taking steps to try to cover it up. That is when conditions on the ground are beginning to deteriorate, but firms are continuing to report strong earnings. The stock market might behave like the corporate sector is still humming along when in reality, its earnings are increasingly buoyed by tricks. The scholars\\' aggregate index is too new to have much of a record. Financial history is littered with recession predictors that worked great using historical data that promptly failed when used to predict the future. It didn\\'t work \"out of sample,\" as statisticians would say. So, it remains to be seen how useful the aggregate M-Score will be. But if there are a lot of things on balance sheets right now that look like fraud, that is probably not a great thing.', 'OTTAWA -- President Biden, making his first trip as president to Canada, said a robust U.S. industrial policy based on producing clean technology, electric vehicles and semiconductors would benefit workers on both sides of the northern border as he joined with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Mr. Biden used an address to the Canadian Parliament to promote their commitment to defending Ukraine, and possibilities for workers through the new healthcare and climate-change law called the Inflation Reduction Act, and another law to promote semiconductor manufacturing. \"We must never doubt our capacity for Canada and the United States to do big things, to stand together. . . . We\\'re going to write the future together,\" he said. The two leaders have maintained warm personal ties, going back to Mr. Biden\\'s time as vice president, and the two sides planned to confer on a range of defense, economic and migration issues. Mr. Trudeau said the two nations are coordinating during \"serious times,\" citing the \"consequences of a warming planet\" that are \"intersecting with the aftermath of a global pandemic.\" He said the passage of Mr. Biden\\'s legislation would mean \"clients for Canadian critical minerals processors, for our clean energy innovators, for our integrated auto workers, for our farmers, growers and producers and so many others.\" The Inflation Reduction Act offers extensive tax credits and other support for clean-energy projects. The incentives have sparked a flood of investments in the U.S., and to Canada. As part of the meetings, the U.S. and Canada reached an deal that would allow both countries to turn back asylum seekers who unlawfully cross the northern border, which has seen an influx in crossings between New York and Quebec. Under the agreement, which begins Saturday, Canada would provide 15,000 slots for migrants to enter legally over the next year on a humanitarian basis from the Western Hemisphere. The meetings in the Canadian capital followed Chinese President Xi Jinping\\'s talks this week in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Messrs. Biden and Trudeau have been staunch allies of Ukraine, and the White House expressed skepticism about China\\'s interest in negotiating a cease-fire in Ukraine, saying it would provide Russian forces with an opportunity to regroup. \"We\\'ve stood together to defend sovereignty, to defend democracy,\" Mr. Biden said. The U.S. and Canada \"must stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine with as much as it takes, for as long as it takes,\" Mr. Trudeau said. On defense, Canada unveiled a timetable on spending plans to upgrade its defense capability in the Arctic, to track and detect threats from Russia and China. U.S. officials pushed Canada to accelerate spending plans, and issue firm commitments on funding sources. Canada said some of the new detection systems could start operating in 2028.', 'BROWNSVILLE, Texas -- Some 1,000 trucks a day arrive from Mexico at a border checkpoint here near the southern tip of Texas. Their first stop is a white-and-yellow painted metal portal where energy beamed at the trucks produces X-ray images to try to spot fentanyl and other contraband. Such scrutiny is rare. Across the southern border, most U.S.-bound trucks and nearly all passenger vehicles are generally scanned selectively if they are pulled aside. Mexican cartels have long profited from these odds while smuggling fentanyl and other narcotics. Their illicit trade propelled the U.S. to a record of nearly 107,000 fatal overdoses in 2021, the most recent year of full data. The U.S. wants to increase routine scanning to try to stanch this flow. President Biden called for more drug-detection technology in last month\\'s State of the Union speech and this month\\'s budget proposal, which included $305 million for new inspection systems, including the technology used in Brownsville. Mexican cartels are the main source of fentanyl, producing it in makeshift labs with Chinese chemicals, according to U.S. law-enforcement authorities. Though cartels have many ways to smuggle in drugs -- from mailed packages to secret tunnels and pedestrian couriers -- authorities said fentanyl is most often hidden in cars and trucks and driven through border checkpoints. \"They\\'re just blitzing the country through the ports of entry,\" said Derek Maltz, a retired Drug Enforcement Administration official who spent 28 years in the agency. The scanners in Brownsville beam energy at a truck in varying levels of intensity. Beaming less energy at the cab allows drivers to stay inside, speeding the process. Directing more energy at the trailer produces an image of the truck that officials can use to spot suspect material within. Sometimes the payload is illicit drugs including fentanyl. Fentanyl\\'s properties make it ideal for smuggling, drug-enforcement experts said. Cars and trucks make more than 200,000 trips across the southern border into the U.S. every day.\"The sheer volume is one of the biggest challenges that we have,\" said Jody Hardin, executive director for planning program analysis and evaluation at U.S. Customs and Border Protection\\'s Office of Field Operations. The explosive opioid problem and violent cartel crime have heightened tensions between the U.S. and Mexico. Just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, in the city of Matamoros, gunmen from a local cartel in March kidnapped four Americans, killing two. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has denied that fentanyl is produced in Mexico while touting renewed cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico in attempts to stop the synthetic opioid from flowing north. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas visited Nogales, Ariz., on March 21 to announce busts following a law-enforcement operation aimed at fentanyl trafficking. Through the first five months of the fiscal year that began in October, CBP said it seized about 11,000 pounds of drugs identified as fentanyl. This is nearly as much as was seized in the full 2021 fiscal year and approaches the 14,700 pounds seized in fiscal 2022. Mr. Mayorkas said the new law-enforcement operation netted some 1,700 pounds of drugs identified as fentanyl, methamphetamine and cocaine. Customs officials want to perform more of what they call nonintrusive inspections, which includes the multi-energy portals on display in Brownsville, to increase the efficiency of processing the huge volume of vehicles arriving daily. \"At the onset we saw a drastic increase in narcotics seizures,\" said Tater Ortiz, who directs the Brownsville port of entry. But a string of busts was followed by a plunge in confiscations as smugglers went elsewhere, he said. The U.S. aims to deploy 123 large-scale scanners along the border by fiscal 2026, growing its ability to perform nonintrusive scans to 70% of cargo vehicles and 40% of passenger vehicles, according to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Historically, the U.S. has performed such scans on only 17% of cargo vehicles and 2% of passenger vehicles, the office said. Adding more scanning technology has to be part of an effort that includes trying to reduce drug demand and the odds overdoses will prove fatal, said David Luckey, a senior Rand Corp. researcher. \"There\\'s no silver bullet,\" he said. Outside Culiacan, home to the Sinaloa Cartel, the operator of a fentanyl lab and counterfeit pill factory said he isn\\'t bothered by the prospect of new technology. \"They don\\'t stop all the cars,\" he said. \"There are lots of ways.\" He said the price of fentanyl has fallen in recent months from about $5,000 per kilogram to $3,500 per kilogram as more people get into the business. At the Brownsville bridge, tractor-trailer trucks line up each day in lanes for their scans. Mr. Ortiz said he doesn\\'t expect a panacea against drug smugglers. \"They always try something new,\" he said. \"So I\\'m sure we will have troubles in the future.\"', 'SINGAPORE -- China\\'s Foreign Ministry criticized the U.S. for targeting TikTok and said Beijing would never require companies to illegally gather data and intelligence from overseas, escalating the debate over the popular app. The U.S. has presumed TikTok\\'s guilt and unreasonably suppressed the app, even though the government has provided no evidence that TikTok threatens its national security, Mao Ning, a ministry spokeswoman, said Friday. \"The Chinese government has never asked and will never ask any company or individual to collect or provide data, information or intelligence located in other countries through means that are in violation of local laws,\" she said. The remarks came a day after lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee hammered TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew in a five-hour hearing Thursday. Swelling bipartisan skepticism after the hearing could cloud the app\\'s future in its most lucrative market.', 'SEOUL -- South Korea\\'s LG Energy Solution Ltd. said it would invest about $5.6 billion in a battery-manufacturing complex in Arizona, the latest in a string of new plants by foreign companies as the U.S. transitions toward cleaner fuels. LG Energy said Friday that the new battery complex in Queen Creek, Ariz., would mainly serve electric-vehicle makers in North America. The amount is about four times as large as what the firm had initially pledged when it first revealed plans last year to manufacture cylindrical batteries for electric vehicles in Arizona, though the project had been up in the air until Friday\\'s announcement. LG Energy said in June 2022 that it was reassessing its investment options due to unprecedented economic conditions. Inflation has been driving up the costs of raw materials and other expenses for manufacturers worldwide. The complex announced Friday will consist of two battery plants and mark the largest investment ever for a stand-alone battery-manufacturing facility in North America, LG Energy said. LG Energy\\'s announcement comes as battery makers have been pushing to build up a bigger production base in the U.S., which is looking to strengthen its local supply chains and reduce reliance on China while speeding up shifts to green technologies. The Biden administration\\'s Inflation Reduction Act has offered billions of dollars in tax credits for EVs sold in the U.S., but applies only if they have a certain value of their battery components assembled in North America. LG Energy said the Arizona plant would meet the eligibility requirements of the EV tax-credits program. \"We believe it\\'s the right move at the right time in order to empower [the] clear energy transition in the U.S.,\" LG Energy Chief Executive Kwon Young-soo said. The EV tax-credits program has stoked complaints from foreign car makers, but has opened business opportunities for non-Chinese battery players including South Korea\\'s LG Energy, Samsung SDI Co. and SK On Co., as well as Japan\\'s Panasonic Holdings Corp., which have all announced plans for new manufacturing plants in the U.S., including many via joint partnership with auto makers.'], ['Vladimir Putin seeks to prevail in Ukraine through an exhausting war of attrition in which he outlasts his opponents, or so the expert consensus has it. The U.S. is supplying weapons to Ukraine at a remarkably slow pace, perhaps for fear of provoking a calamitous Russian escalation. It seems as if Washington is playing right into Mr. Putin\\'s hands. But maybe not everything is as it seems. If I learned anything from decades as a Russian-speaking Central Intelligence Agency operations officer working against the Kremlin\\'s intelligence services, it was to be wary of anything they show you. This looks to me too convenient a narrative for Moscow, and one that\\'s belied by the facts. WSJ Opinion Live Q&A: The New World Disorder The threats to global stability and the US homeland are growing. How will the war in Ukraine end? Can China and the US develop a less combative relationship? Join historian and Journal columnist Walter Russell Mead and editorial page editor Paul Gigot for an interactive conversation on the threats to US security. Mr. Putin acts as if he doesn\\'t believe he can survive if he quits this conflict. But in reality, the war is existential only for the Ukrainian side. Ukrainians would suffer cultural genocide and war crimes if they gave in. Russia can walk away without serious consequences beyond its borders, and Mr. Putin knows it. He can ill afford for the Russian people to realize that they could not only overcome defeat, but never had to fight in the first place. But it\\'s not clear that the solution the Kremlin really wants is a war of attrition. Can anyone, even Mr. Putin, imagine the Ukrainians quitting? If they lose external support, they still face an existential threat. It seems probable Ukraine would dig in and fight as long as it possibly could, even if the conflict devolved to guerrilla warfare in occupied streets. Mr. Putin has to be accounting for this. He gambled wrong a year ago when he expected Ukrainian resolve to collapse quickly as Russian forces rolled in. Though he projects an inflexible image, Mr. Putin seems to still think like an intelligence officer. They rarely make the same mistake twice, particularly when they\\'ve been embarrassed. Were he really as reckless and blind to reality as he\\'s sometimes depicted, Russian forces wouldn\\'t have withdrawn from Kyiv\\'s outskirts a year ago. Mr. Putin has shown that he will bend when faced with serious consequences. And that\\'s what a long war would entail. Mr. Putin might not grieve his heavy casualties, but they are embarrassing to the Kremlin and undermine his narrative of strength and military prowess. As Russian lines thin, he will feel increased pressure to expand mobilization beyond the rural and ethnic communities he has targeted to insulate his urban political base from the war\\'s consequences. While some scoff at the effectiveness of Western economic sanctions, Moscow is furiously working to strengthen the ruble and find alternative consumers for the energy exports most of Europe has forsaken. But this still means lower profit, as Russia lures clients with increasingly discounted oil and gas. As the war endures, Mr. Putin will meet increasingly difficult choices between funding the conflict and improving the economy. And whatever military supplies Russia seeks from China, Iran and North Korea are hardly charitable donations—there\\'s no dictator\\'s discount. Even ruble remittances from new trade partners won\\'t help Mr. Putin pay off foreign debt held in U.S. dollars. And less income leaves less resources to dispense to those domestic political allies Mr. Putin needs to maintain control. All this suggests that the longer the war endures, the worse things get for Moscow. Time allows Ukraine to deploy the sophisticated weapons now en route and the freshly trained Ukrainian operators returning from the West. More time will also enable the increased productivity of ammunition supply chains the U.S. is building. Add it all up, and Ukraine will likely have what\\'s needed for its much-anticipated counteroffensive. Mr. Putin may repulse those forces, but betting everything that he can is an immensely risky gamble. If Ukraine prevails, could he survive losing Crimea and having his forces violently pushed back across Russian borders? Mr. Putin likely doesn\\'t hope for a war of attrition but wants the world to think he does. His disinformation campaigns have been designed to depict himself, and Russia, as stronger than they are. If he faces an unwinnable war, the best outcome he can hope for is to mask that weakness and intimidate his foes into blinking first. Ukraine may not want to give up, but if an outside power can broker a peace deal, that is Mr. Putin\\'s best option by a long shot. His openness to China\\'s lopsided peace proposal suggests that he is eager to fold with gains still in hand. What he likely most fears is the U.S. and its allies slamming the accelerator. Pushing the Russian leader isn\\'t without risk, but validating his narrative is more likely to weaken Western resolve and escalate the conflict by inviting him to test its thresholds. It\\'s imperative that Washington instead work to make the war too costly to Mr. Putin to remove any doubt of Western resolve. Be wary of whatever cards he chooses to show.

Executives in the industry are betting it is worth drilling again in some of the hardest places to do business in the world as Europe increasingly turns to other sources for its energy needs after shunning its main supplier, Russia, over the invasion of Ukraine . In recent months, a string of European officials have visited the region to help advance talks over potential supply deals. Halliburton and Honeywell International Inc. are hammering out $1.4 billion worth of deals to develop an oil field and refinery with National Oil Corporation in Libya, which has the largest known oil reserves in Africa, according to the chairman of state-owned firm, Farhat Bengdara. Italy\\'s Eni is planning investments aimed at replacing nearly half of the gas it was importing from Russia with gas from Algeria. Chevron is also looking to seal an energy exploration deal in Algeria, The Wall Street Journal reported last month . In January, the U.S. oil major announced a sizable natural-gas discovery in Egypt. \"North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,\" said Geoff Porter, president of U.S.-based North Africa Risk Consulting Inc. But with Europe needing to replace Russian energy , \"this is their moment,\" he said. Western oil executives say they see a more stable political climate in North Africa, especially in countries such as Libya where fighting between local militias has been subdued in the past two years following nearly a decade of civil war. Many American firms had pulled back from the region, viewing it as politically too risky, to focus on shale production at home. The region\\'s proximity to Europe and massive reserves, with Algeria holding the third-largest recoverable shale resources in the world, also make doing business there worth the risk, they say. At the same time, state-owned firms in the North African region have been eager to strike deals, as they see an opportunity to fill a gap left by Russia and take advantage of higher global commodity prices. Some countries, such as Egypt, are eager to bring in additional revenue from selling energy, as their economies struggle with higher import costs including for food . The Ukraine war has disrupted shipments and pushed up global commodity prices. \"I think we can be a good replacement for Russian gas to Europe,\" NOC\\'s Mr. Bengdara said. The Libyan state-owned company is expected to soon sign a $1 billion agreement with Halliburton that will allow the U.S. firm to rebuild the al-Dhara oil field, according to Mr. Bengdara. The oil field in central Libya was destroyed by Islamic State militants in 2015 and is now run by ConocoPhillips and TotalEnergies SE, Mr. Bengdara said. It would be one of the biggest deals for the U.S. oil-services giant clinched in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years. Halliburton and Total didn\\'t respond to requests for comment. ConocoPhillips declined to comment. Libya\\'s NOC and Honeywell are set to unveil a contract related to the construction of a refinery in southern Libya, Mr. Bengdara and a spokesman for the American firm said. The initial deal, expected to be announced this weekend, is for the design of the plant, the spokesman said, which would be followed by a $400 million pact to build the entire plant. Libya relies heavily on its oil resources for income, although it has struggled for years to turn its own crude into motor fuel, making it largely dependent on costly gasoline imports. As of last year, the North African nation was divided politically again, with a United Nations-appointed prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, remaining in control of the capital Tripoli and a rival prime minister taking charge of the country\\'s east. The country is again pushing to hold presidential and legislative elections this year, after plans fell through in 2021. Still, there have been no serious clashes since last summer and its eastern government in recent months has unlocked some of the budget needed by the state oil company to clinch deals with international companies. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a senate committee on Wednesday that the U.S. was actively working to reopen an embassy in Libya, in part so it could better support the prospect of Libyan elections. The U.S. shut its embassy in Tripoli in 2014 following violent clashes between militias. The U.S. also pressured a top Libyan commander in mid-January to expel Russia\\'s paramilitary Wagner Group , the Journal reported last month, amid fears the unit may tap into the country\\'s oil riches. Khalifa Haftar, commander of a faction that controls eastern Libya , is aligned with the government in Tripoli . \"There is recognition in the U.S. that Libya is a workable environment,\" said Mr. Porter, who advises U.S. oil companies in the region. He added that firms now see it as \"an environment in which you can operate reasonably safely, where you can more predictably invest in ways that you could not have a few years ago.\" NOC exports most of its gas to Europe through a pipeline from Libya to Italy. Over the next three to five years, it aims to increase oil production to 2 million barrels a day, from around 1.2 million currently, and to produce 4 billion standard cubic feet of gas a day, up from roughly 2.6 billion. In January, NOC and Eni, which produces the majority of the country\\'s gas, signed an $8 billion deal for the Italian energy giant to develop two gas fields to pump 850 million cubic feet a day for 25 years. Under the agreement, production of gas will start in 2025, ramping up to full capacity of 850 million cubic feet a day by 2026. In Algeria, Eni is aiming to export an additional 3 billion cubic meters of gas annually, starting this year, to help make up for gas that used to flow from Russia. Algeria will become the firm\\'s top region for investment in the next four years. \"Algeria is a reliable partner of absolute strategic importance,\" said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during a visit to Algiers in January. From Egypt, Eni aims to export three billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Italy starting this year, after regas capacity was built up on the receiving end. That compares with roughly 1 billion cubic meters being exported last year. Egypt\\'s ability to export gas is limited given the growing electricity demand of its more than 100 million population. It doesn\\'t have any pipelines to Europe. Still, the country has ambitions to become a hub for energy distribution in the Mediterranean, importing more gas from Israel and exporting liquefied gas on ships to Italy.

Mr. Biden used an address to the Canadian Parliament to promote their commitment to defending Ukraine in its war against Russia , and future possibilities for workers through the new healthcare and climate change law called the Inflation Reduction Act, and another law to promote semiconductor manufacturing. \"We must never doubt our capacity for Canada and the United States to do big things, to stand together, do them together, rise together. We\\'re going to write the future together,\" Mr. Biden told members of Parliament, who frequently interrupted his address with applause. Canada is frequently among the first visits by a new U.S. president, but Mr. Biden\\'s trip was delayed in part due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The two leaders have maintained warm personal ties, going back to Mr. Biden\\'s time as vice president, and the two sides planned to confer on a range of defense, economic and migration issues. Mr. Trudeau, in an address to Parliament welcoming Mr. Biden, said the two nations were serving alongside each other during \"serious times,\" citing the \"consequences of a warming planet\" that are \"intersecting with the aftermath of a global pandemic.\" Mr. Trudeau said the passage of Mr. Biden\\'s legislation would mean \"clients for Canadian critical minerals processors, for our clean energy innovators, for our integrated auto workers, for our farmers, growers and producers and so many others.\" The Inflation Reduction Act offers extensive tax credits and other support for clean-energy projects, ranging from wind farms to factories that make solar-energy components or batteries. The incentives have sparked a flood of investments in the U.S., and to Canada as well. Canada is one of the few places in the Western Hemisphere with the raw materials required for the clean-energy transition, and the U.S. credits also cover products made in Canada. America\\'s clean-energy incentives have prompted governments in Europe and Asia to mull their own set of financial incentives to maintain or attract investments. The European Union plans to allow matching subsidies for specific European clean-tech sectors that officials believe are at risk from the IRA. As part of the meetings, the U.S. and Canada reached an agreement that would allow both countries to turn back asylum seekers who unlawfully cross the northern border, which has seen an influx in border crossings between New York and Quebec. Under the agreement, which begins Saturday, Canada would provide 15,000 slots for migrants to enter legally over the next year on a humanitarian basis from the Western Hemisphere. Mr. Biden later took questions from journalists during a joint news conference alongside Mr. Trudeau. The Canadian leader was capping the visit by holding a gala event honoring the president before Mr. Biden returned to his home in Wilmington, Del. The meetings in the Canadian capital followed Chinese President Xi Jinping\\'s talks this week in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Both Messrs. Biden and Trudeau have been staunch allies of Ukraine and the White House expressed skepticism about China\\'s interest in negotiating a cease-fire in Ukraine, saying it would provide Russian forces with an opportunity to regroup. \"We\\'ve stood together to defend sovereignty, to defend democracy,\" Mr. Biden said. Mr. Trudeau said both the U.S. and Canada \"must stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine with as much as it takes, for as long as it takes.\" On defense, Canada unveiled a timetable on spending plans to upgrade its defense capability in the Arctic, to track and detect threats from Russia and China, as part of the two countries\\' joint defense of continental aerospace through the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or Norad. U.S. officials pushed Canada to accelerate spending plans, and issue firm commitments on funding sources. Canada said some of the new detection systems could start operating in 2028. Defense of the Arctic has taken on greater emphasis after a U.S. military jet shot down an unidentified airborne object last month over Canada\\'s Yukon territory. Among NATO members, Canada has trailed in defense spending, at 1.27% of gross domestic product—well below the organization\\'s 2% guideline. The U.S. had pressed Mr. Trudeau to have Canada lead an international force in Haiti to deal with domestic unrest in the Caribbean country. Canada said Friday it would contribute about $70 million to help support Haitian police. Mr. Trudeau has said the country, which has a large Haitian Canadian community in Quebec, stands ready to help should the situation deteriorate, but has stopped short of committing to sending troops. Write to Ken Thomas at ken.thomas@wsj.com and Paul Vieira at Paul.Vieira@wsj.com', 'WASHINGTON—Momentum in Congress to crack down on TikTok is growing after the chief executive of the social-media company failed to win over lawmakers in a marathon hearing, though lawmakers are divided on what path to take . Republicans and Democrats pounced on TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, his company and its Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance Ltd., in the hearing Thursday. Over five hours, lawmakers seemed dissatisfied with Mr. Chew\\'s answers on Beijing\\'s potential influence over the video-sharing app, as well as concerns about the effect that the app\\'s algorithm has on teens and young adults. The TikTok hearing \"left more questions than answers,\" said Rep. John Curtis (R., Utah). \"I don\\'t think any of us walked away feeling that our data is safe or that there is any accountability for TikTok.\" Mr. Curtis hasn\\'t signed on to any bills yet, saying he wants to see details first. Several bills restricting TikTok use through privacy legislation or an outright ban on the app have been introduced in Congress or discussed, but no clear path has emerged. It remained unclear if lawmakers\\' denunciations of TikTok would result in passing legislation and sending it to President Biden\\'s desk. The idea of a ban started during the Trump administration and lawmakers from both parties have expressed concerns over the platform, which uses an algorithm to show users short-form videos. Last year, Congress passed legislation banning TikTok from federal government devices and some states have made similar moves. In a shift, Democrats who have seemed more resistant to banning the application or taking other actions also signaled they were more ready to join with Republicans on legislation to strengthen the government\\'s hand in fighting potential threats posed by foreign-controlled apps. \"There\\'s a groundswell of support for this, from Americans and elected officials on both sides of the aisle, as we see that this one app gives the [Chinese Communist Party] the ability to control what a generation of kids see and consume,\" said Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D., N.J.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, who has long advocated for a ban or sale of TikTok. \"There is bipartisan, growing consensus to get this app off of U.S. phones before further damage is done,\" said Rep. Ashley Hinson (R., Iowa). House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said he was engaged in talks about legislation with Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Mr. Warner is sponsoring legislation with Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) to give the government broad powers to restrict and even ban foreign-controlled apps that pose national-security risks. \"I think you could find a very bipartisan bill,\" Mr. McCarthy said Friday. \"I know the Senate is working on one but I believe the House will get one done and we\\'ll pass it through.\" The Warner-Thune bill, known as the Restrict Act, would grant the Commerce Department new authority to regulate foreign-owned apps. The White House reiterated Thursday that it backs the legislation. Any legislative steps on TikTok or big tech are tricky, both politically and practically. Adopting new laws restricting foreign apps has its own complexities, including potential First Amendment implications. The hearing also showed growing consensus to take action to amend Section 230, a provision in the 1996 Communications Decency Act that spells out who is legally responsible for content on the internet. It shields social-media companies from responsibility for what is posted on their sites. Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D., N.Y.) hosted a press conference on Thursday with about 20 TikTok influencers and suggested xenophobia against China was at play and Congress should focus instead on addressing broader concerns about social media. The Biden administration recently demanded that TikTok\\'s Chinese owners sell their stakes in the company or face a possible U.S. ban of the app. Mr. Chew told lawmakers he didn\\'t think a change in ownership would improve safety and security, pointing to the privacy problems of U.S. tech platforms. China issued a statement ahead of the hearing saying it would oppose any forced sale of TikTok , with its Commerce Ministry saying that any sale would involve the export of Chinese technology and must be approved by the Chinese government. TikTok executives have said that 60% of ByteDance shares are owned by global investors, 20% by employees and 20% by its founders, though the founders\\' shares carry outsize voting rights, as is common with tech companies. TikTok has pledged to spend $1.5 billion on a program to safeguard U.S. user data and content from Chinese government access or influence. Lawmakers who favor putting restrictions on the company have said that plan isn\\'t sufficient, saying any Chinese-owned company must comply with demands from Beijing if called upon. Many in Congress said they would back stricter controls on apps tied to hostile governments, but also wanted to enact comprehensive privacy legislation affecting all big tech platforms, not just foreign-controlled ones. \"We must prevent any app, website, and platform like TikTok from ever spying on Americans again and we must provide the strongest protections possible for our children,\" said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.), who chairs the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. Some lawmakers urged caution. \"Taking a step to ban access to a media platform is a very big step,\" said Rep. Jim Himes (D., Conn.), a member of the intelligence panel. \"Are we going to ban access to Belarusian newspapers, you know? I\\'m not saying it\\'s wrong. I\\'m just saying let\\'s slow the feeding frenzy down now and take a deep breath,\" he said. Write to Natalie Andrews at natalie.andrews@wsj.com', 'BROWNSVILLE, Texas—Some 1,000 trucks a day arrive from Mexico at a border checkpoint here near the southern tip of Texas. Their first stop is a white-and-yellow painted metal portal where energy beamed at the trucks produces X-ray images to try to spot fentanyl and other contraband. Such scrutiny is rare. Across the southern border, most U.S.-bound trucks and nearly all passenger vehicles are generally scanned selectively if they are pulled aside. Mexican cartels have long profited from these odds while smuggling fentanyl and other narcotics . Their illicit trade propelled the U.S. to a record of nearly 107,000 fatal overdoses in 2021, the most recent year of full data. The U.S. wants to increase routine scanning of vehicles arriving from Mexico. President Biden called for more drug-detection technology in last month\\'s State of the Union speech and this month\\'s budget proposal, which included $305 million for new inspection systems, including the technology used in Brownsville. Mexican cartels are the main source of illicit fentanyl , producing it in makeshift labs with Chinese chemicals , according to U.S. law-enforcement authorities. Though cartels have many ways to smuggle in drugs—from mailed packages to secret tunnels and pedestrian couriers—authorities said fentanyl is most often hidden in cars and trucks and driven through border checkpoints. \"They\\'re just blitzing the country through the ports of entry,\" said Derek Maltz, a retired Drug Enforcement Administration official who spent 28 years in the agency. The scanners in Brownsville beam energy at a truck in varying levels of intensity. Beaming less energy at the cab allows drivers to stay inside, speeding the process. Directing more energy at the trailer produces an image of the truck that officials can use to spot suspect material within. Sometimes the payload is illicit drugs including fentanyl. Fentanyl\\'s properties—it is cheap and extremely potent in small amounts —make it ideal for smuggling, drug-enforcement experts said. And the busy southern border, a vital link between major trading partners, sees a flood of cars and trucks crossing each day. \"The sheer volume is one of the biggest challenges that we have,\" said Jody Hardin, executive director for planning program analysis and evaluation at U.S. Customs and Border Protection\\'s Office of Field Operations. The explosive opioid problem and violent cartel crime have heightened tensions between the U.S. and Mexico. Just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, in the city of Matamoros, gunmen from a local cartel in March kidnapped four Americans, killing two . Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has denied that fentanyl is produced in Mexico while touting renewed cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico in attempts to stop the synthetic opioid from flowing north. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas visited Nogales, Ariz., on March 21 to announce busts following a law-enforcement operation aimed at fentanyl trafficking. Mr. Mayorkas said the new law-enforcement operation netted some 1,700 pounds of drugs identified as fentanyl, methamphetamine and cocaine. More broadly, U.S. authorities say they have seen a significant increase in fentanyl seizures in the current fiscal year. Customs officials want to perform more of what they call nonintrusive inspections, which include the multi-energy portals on display in Brownsville, to increase the efficiency of processing the huge volume of vehicles arriving daily. \"At the onset, we saw a drastic increase in narcotics seizures,\" said Tater Ortiz, who directs the Brownsville port of entry. But a string of busts was followed by a plunge in confiscations as smugglers went elsewhere, he said. The scans flag vehicles that need to be more thoroughly checked, Ms. Hardin said. Two other Texas border sites are using low-energy scanning equipment that can peer into cars, she said. The U.S. aims to deploy 123 large-scale scanners along the border by fiscal 2026, growing its ability to perform nonintrusive scans to 70% of cargo vehicles and 40% of passenger vehicles, according to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Historically, the U.S. has only performed such scans on 17% of cargo vehicles and 2% of passenger vehicles, the office said. Adding more scanning technology has to be part of an effort that includes trying to reduce drug demand and the odds overdoses will prove fatal, said David Luckey, a senior Rand Corp. researcher. He co-led a team that produced a report last year for a commission on synthetic opioids that includes members of Congress and law-enforcement agencies. \"There\\'s no silver bullet,\" he said. Outside Culiacán, home to the Sinaloa Cartel, the operator of a fentanyl lab and counterfeit pill factory said he isn\\'t bothered by the prospect of new technology. \"They don\\'t stop all the cars,\" he said. \"There are lots of ways.\" He said the price of fentanyl has fallen in recent months from about $5,000 per kilogram to $3,500 per kilogram as more people get into the business. Dr. Rahul Gupta, Mr. Biden\\'s drug czar, said the administration is disrupting the flow of drugs. He cited preliminary federal overdose reports tracking 12-month death totals, month by month, which have recently edged lower. Preliminary numbers through October indicate the U.S. might still record more than 100,000 fatalities for the second year in a row . At the Brownsville bridge, tractor-trailer trucks, many full of auto parts, line up each day in lanes for their scans. Mr. Ortiz, who has served on the border for 32 years, said he doesn\\'t expect a panacea against drug smugglers. \"They always try something new,\" he said. \"So I\\'m sure we will have troubles in the future.\" Write to José de Córdoba at jose.decordoba@wsj.com and Jon Kamp at Jon.Kamp@wsj.com', 'America\\'s biggest cigarette company has a new plan to shift its business toward less-harmful products, after a string of failures. This time, the Marlboro maker says, its plan will work. Altria Group Inc. earlier this month divested itself of e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc., recording a loss of at least $12.5 billion. Altria now has a new lineup of e-cigarettes, heated-tobacco devices and oral nicotine pouches in the works, including the planned acquisition of vaping pioneer NJOY Holdings Inc. Altria said it hopes to take its reduced-risk products overseas and is considering expanding into non-nicotine offerings such as cannabis products or caffeine pouches. \"Previously, we were chasing the market,\" Chief Executive Billy Gifford said in an interview, referring to Altria\\'s past attempts to develop or acquire vaping products. \"You\\'re constantly watching what the consumer is telling you in the marketplace, but none of them were satisfying the consumer enough to ultimately meet all of their needs and desires.\" Now Altria is soliciting smokers\\' feedback during the development process, and making tweaks based on that feedback, Mr. Gifford said. Altria this week for the first time set volume and revenue goals for its transition to smoke-free products: It aims to increase its smoke-free sales volume by at least 35% over the next five years. Altria agreed to buy vaping pioneer NJOY Holdings earlier this month. PHOTO: Angela Owens/The Wall Street Journal It also wants to roughly double its net revenue from smoke-free products to $5 billion by 2028, including $2 billion from new reduced-risk products. Last year, Altria reported $2.6 billion in net revenue from smoke-free products, nearly all from moist smokeless-tobacco brands such as Copenhagen. Many of the new products in Altria\\'s plan haven\\'t yet been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration and can\\'t go on the market until they are. That process could take years. NJOY is one of the few e-cigarette makers whose products have clearance from federal regulators. But Altria\\'s acquisition must first pass a federal antitrust review. Mr. Gifford said he is optimistic but can\\'t project when the deal would close. Altria\\'s lineup includes two prototypes unveiled this week: a higher-nicotine version of its On! pouch and a device called Swic that heats a single-use metal capsule containing tobacco. The FDA so far has authorized only tobacco-flavored vaping products . NJOY plans to seek authorization for watermelon and blueberry flavors in a new version of its device that uses a Bluetooth connection to authenticate the user before unlocking, according to people familiar with the matter. Altria in 2018 voluntarily pulled its own fruit-flavored e-cigarettes off the market, saying that those flavors were contributing to a rise in underage use. In the interview Thursday, Mr. Gifford said that flavored e-cigarettes help adult smokers switch from cigarettes and that NJOY\\'s locked version would mitigate the risk to young people. Speaking about the company\\'s plans to explore non-nicotine products, Mr. Gifford pointed to people who used to use cigarettes to take a break, reward themselves, multitask or socialize. \"Those consumers didn\\'t stop enjoying those moments,\" he said. \"They replaced it with other stuff. It could be caffeine—anything in that energy space. Some are now using their phone.\" Altria executives said they hope to use non-nicotine products to reach a broader consumer base in similar everyday moments. \"How do you meet them in that moment and fix their unmet needs and desires?\" Mr. Gifford said. Altria struggled for years to develop e-cigarettes that appealed to smokers as U.S. cigarette sales declined. Among the stumbling blocks was trouble recruiting product developers. The company\\'s e-cigarettes leaked. And they lacked the nicotine kick smokers were looking for. Altria closed its e-cigarette business in 2018, shortly before it paid nearly $13 billion for a 35% stake in Juul . The vaping market leader\\'s valuation quickly evaporated . Altria last year recruited Olivier Houpert, an alumnus of Procter & Gamble Co., to be its chief innovation and product officer. Mr. Gifford said he hopes to bring talent from NJOY. And he said Altria is better able to recruit now because of its remote-work policy. He and Mr. Houpert said the company plans to invest in early-stage startups with promising technology and to work with external partners on technical aspects such as electronics. Mr. Gifford served as Altria\\'s finance chief before he was tapped in 2020 to succeed Howard Willard , the CEO who forged the company\\'s ill-fated Juul deal. Mr. Gifford, who grew up outside Richmond, Va., said he began dipping Copenhagen smokeless tobacco on hunting trips with his father. Now 52, he said he exclusively uses On!, Altria\\'s oral nicotine-pouch brand. At an investor presentation Thursday, he had a cinnamon-flavored pouch tucked in his cheek as he fielded questions from analysts. States including California are enforcing bans on menthol cigarettes, and the Biden Administration is moving forward with plans to ban them nationwide . The administration also has said it intends to mandate the near-elimination of nicotine in all cigarettes sold in the U.S. The menthol and nicotine rules would take years to implement. Altria opposes both and has been lobbying for policies that \"support harm reduction and avoid prohibition,\" executives said. Cigarette smoking is linked to 480,000 deaths in the U.S. each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. U.S. health officials have said they want to encourage cigarette smokers who can\\'t quit to switch to less-harmful products such as e-cigarettes. Write to Jennifer Maloney at Jennifer.Maloney@wsj.com', 'Global economic growth rebounded modestly this month, although stubbornly high inflation and banking stresses weigh on the outlook. Business surveys published Friday recorded pickups in activity across the U.S. and Europe driven by services providers. Japan saw a similar acceleration aided by the arrival of tourists from China after the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. Policy makers in the U.S. and Europe in particular are navigating treacherous currents this year. Central banks have kept raising interest rates to cool economic activity and bring down persistently high inflation. But those higher rates are causing pain in the financial sector, including recent failures of U.S. banks including Silicon Valley Bank and troubles for European banks such as Deutsche Bank AG. The U.S. economy showed signs of strength early this year, with a solid job market and increased consumer spending. If banks tighten credit in response to industry stress, though, that could in turn cool the economy and raise the risk of a recession. Confidence slipped at U.S. businesses to a three-month low in March, according to a Friday survey by data firm S&P Global, amid worries about inflation, financial-market uncertainty and higher borrowing costs. But the survey, conducted March 10 to 23, also reported the fastest uptick in business activity in almost a year, suggesting U.S. businesses have so far seen a limited impact from banking-sector stresses. Surveys of European businesses conducted by S&P Global also pointed to a pickup in growth, and the avoidance of a recession that many had predicted when energy prices surged in the wake of Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago. Rapid rate rises in the U.S. and Europe this past year have jolted the regions\\' economies, with some banks becoming casualties. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank roiled markets and sent depositors fleeing, stoking fears of contagion. Regulators bailed out uninsured depositors to stave off a panic. In Europe, regulators shepherded UBS Group AG\\'s takeover of longtime rival Credit Suisse Group AG, which had been weakened by years of self-inflicted scandals and trading losses. Central bankers and regulators have said those strains have been contained, but it may take months before confidence in the banking system is fully restored. \"There are good chances to contain this,\" said Jens Magnusson, chief economist at Sweden\\'s SEB. \"We will have weeks and probably months when we will have to be very attentive to any signs of stress.\" In addition to U.S. and European economic resilience, China\\'s abandonment of its zero-Covid policy has pointed to a better-than-expected outlook for the global economy this year. And while recent data points to a pickup in activity within China itself, business surveys also point to positive impacts elsewhere. Japan\\'s services sector grew at the fastest pace since October 2013 as Chinese tourists rushed to take advantage of their new freedom to travel overseas. Stronger growth comes with its own downsides for central bankers who have been busy pouring cold water on the global economy. While the business surveys also pointed to a slowdown in the pace at which businesses are raising their prices, that pace remains very high by historical standards. \"Such stubborn inflationary pressures, fueled primarily by the service sector and rising wage costs, will be a concern to policy makers and suggest that more work may be needed in terms of bringing inflation down to target,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. When strains in the banking system first became apparent, investors trimmed expectations of future rate rises by the world\\'s leading central banks. But those central banks have recently announced a series of rate increases, with some signaling that there are likely to be more to come given the persistence of high inflation. The Federal Reserve approved another quarter-percentage-point interest-rate increase on Wednesday, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaling that banking-industry problems might end U.S. rate increases sooner than previously thought. The depth of the banking crisis will determine the path of the global economy, economists say. \"If there are no further problems, it\\'s a has-been and the global economy will keep on chugging,\" said Jesse Rogers, an economist at Moody\\'s Analytics. \"If there\\'s broader rot that we\\'re yet to find out about, we\\'re in a recession in the U.S., with most areas of the global economy in recession,\" he added. Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com and Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com', 'SINGAPORE—China\\'s Foreign Ministry criticized the U.S. for targeting TikTok and said Beijing would never require companies to illegally gather data and intelligence from overseas, escalating the debate over the popular app a day after its chief executive was pummeled in Congress . The U.S. has presumed TikTok\\'s guilt and unreasonably suppressed the app, even though the government has provided no evidence that TikTok threatens its national security , Mao Ning, a ministry spokeswoman, said Friday. \"The Chinese government has never asked and will never ask any company or individual to collect or provide data, information or intelligence located in other countries through means that are in violation of local laws,\" she said. The remarks came a day after lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee hammered TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew in a five-hour hearing Thursday. Mr. Chew had sought to allay lawmakers\\' concerns about the security of TikTok users\\' data, as well as about whether China influences content that 150 million American users consume , but appeared to change few minds. His job was made harder when China\\'s Commerce Ministry weighed in ahead of the hearing, saying it would strongly oppose any demand that TikTok\\'s Chinese owners sell their stakes, adding that a sale or divestiture of TikTok would require government approval. The travails of TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., have put it at the center of strained ties between the world\\'s two great economic powers. Swelling bipartisan skepticism after the hearing could cloud the app\\'s future in its most lucrative market. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.) opened the hearing by asking Mr. Chew to state \"with 100% certainty\" that Beijing couldn\\'t use TikTok to surveil Americans or manipulate the content Americans see. Mr. Chew said the company is committed to firewalling U.S. user data from \"all unwanted foreign access\" and would keep content \"free from any manipulation from any government.\" \"If you can\\'t say it 100% certain, I take that as a \\'no,\\'\" Mrs. Rodgers shot back. Mr. Chew said Project Texas—a TikTok proposal to store U.S. user data in the country with oversight by American personnel—addresses the concern that TikTok user data could be accessed by Beijing. He also acknowledged that currently engineers globally could access such data as required for business purposes. His responses did little to damp the fury on Capitol Hill. Rep. Frank Pallone (D., N.J.), the panel\\'s top Democrat, said he wasn\\'t convinced that TikTok\\'s security plans would work. \"I still believe that the Beijing communist government will still control and have the ability to influence what you do,\" he said. After the hearing ended, TikTok spokeswoman Brooke Oberwetter said political grandstanding had dominated, ignoring solutions that TikTok was working on to protect user data and keep content harmful to young people off the site. Write to Raffaele Huang at raffaele.huang@wsj.com', 'TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has kept out of the limelight until recently. PHOTO: Alyssa Schukar for The Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON—TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Zi Chew has navigated both Western and Chinese business over the course of his fast rise to the corner office. That cultural straddle has helped land him the top job at one of the world\\'s biggest tech companies. His background also provided a potential connection with a skeptical American Congress . Many members have threatened to ban TikTok , saying its Chinese ownership poses a national-security threat . But on Thursday, the 40-year-old Singaporean army reservist and former Goldman Sachs banker faced a hostile House panel as he tried to reassure Americans their data is safe and Beijing won\\'t be able to influence what viewers see on TikTok. Hours before the testimony, Beijing said it would oppose a forced sale of the app from its Chinese owners, something the Biden administration has demanded . That amped up the hearing\\'s geopolitical dimensions, thrusting Mr. Chew into the middle of souring U.S.-China relations. House lawmakers then pummeled TikTok\\'s chief executive over the popular app\\'s ties to China. The congressional hearing was peppered with withering attacks on TikTok from both Democrats and Republicans, running more than five hours and underscoring growing concern about Beijing\\'s potential influence over the app. Born and raised in Singapore, then educated in London and at Harvard Business School, Mr. Chew spent some of his early career cutting deals for a venture-capital firm in Asia. He then quickly moved to the C-suite as the chief financial officer of a Chinese smartphone giant at age 32. He runs TikTok from offices in Singapore, but travels often, including frequently to the U.S. He met his wife, a Taiwanese-American who grew up in Bethesda, Md., at Harvard. Relatively unknown for the boss of one of the world\\'s most popular apps, Mr. Chew was sharply questioned by some of the company\\'s more skeptical critics on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Aides to the Republicans who control the committee say there is essentially nothing Mr. Chew can say that would change their minds as they threaten a nationwide ban. In an interview from the company\\'s WeWork offices in Washington, he said he views Thursday\\'s hearing as a chance to explain what TikTok is trying to do, and to get feedback from Congress members—not a last-gasp effort to save TikTok\\'s American business. \"I look at it as an opportunity to do that, not a do-or-die\" moment, he said. The corporate stakes for Mr. Chew are as high as they get for a CEO facing such an appearance in Washington. Some Congress members from both major parties are pushing for a nationwide ban of the video app, citing national-security threats. The Biden administration is demanding TikTok divest itself from its Chinese parent ByteDance Ltd. or face such a ban. Critics say China could force TikTok to hand over American user data or influence what American viewers see on the app. TikTok has said it has never received such a request and would refuse to comply with one. Mr. Chew took over the top job after Kevin Mayer, a high-profile Walt Disney Co. alum, left his post after three months, while the Trump administration pursued an earlier effort to force a sale of TikTok to U.S. investors. He is a native English speaker who, like most Singaporeans, is of Chinese ancestry. His father worked in construction and his mother in bookkeeping. He said he was uprooted from a modest upbringing at age 12, when high marks on a national exam sent him to an elite high school. Mr. Chew was put on an officer track during his mandatory 2½ years of military service. That added 10 years to his eligibility for reserve duty, which ends when he is 50. The hardest physical experience of his life, he said, was the military\\'s five-day survival course in Brunei\\'s jungles. He built a hut, cooked wild yams and trekked 55 miles. At one point during such courses, trainees are given a live quail that they can kill with their hands before skinning and cooking it. In the interview, Mr. Chew didn\\'t want to discuss what he did with his bird. After the military, Mr. Chew attended University College London and remained in the British capital to work as a banker for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Following an internship at Meta Platforms Inc.\\'s Facebook and business school, Mr. Chew worked for venture-capital firm DST Global. His high-school-level Mandarin qualified him to be its China-focused partner. In 2012, he visited the Chinese equivalent of a Silicon Valley garage: an apartment in Beijing\\'s university district. Thirty people, including a chef, crammed in to develop an app that suggested news articles to people based on factors such as how much time they spent on previous stories. The company was ByteDance Ltd ., which would later go on to create TikTok. Its founder, a young Zhang Yiming, won over Mr. Chew. He and his partners invested in the company. \"The idea is so simple but so powerful: that you should be looking at content not based on who you know, but really based on your own behavior,\" Mr. Chew said. Another investment Mr. Chew led was in Xiaomi Corp., a Chinese smartphone giant with global ambitions. Xiaomi brought him over first as chief financial officer, and then had him run its business outside China. One thing that stood out among colleagues was his grasp of both Chinese and Western business cultures. \"He\\'s perfectly bicultural,\" said Hugo Barra, a former Xiaomi executive who worked with Mr. Chew. \"That\\'s a critical asset for an executive of a Chinese company trying to become a global company.\" Mr. Chew led Xiaomi to an initial public offering in 2018, but its shares struggled immediately afterward, during a difficult financial period for Chinese tech companies. In 2021, Mr. Zhang, who had kept in touch with Mr. Chew, asked the Singaporean to become the finance chief of ByteDance, which in addition to TikTok operates other popular Chinese apps. Mr. Chew did that for two months until he and the founder decided he would be better off running TikTok. TikTok has rolled out billions of dollars of spending aimed at siloing off the app from its Chinese owners, and it said it would hire Oracle Corp. to independently monitor against any interference by Beijing. The measures amount to what the company says is an unprecedented effort to assure Americans their data is safe—one that keeps TikTok unprofitable for now. TikTok faces the ban from Washington while it continues to be hugely popular across the country. Mr. Chew, in his own TikTok video on Tuesday, appealed directly to American users, calling attention to the possible ban. In the video he said the app had 150 million users in the U.S., almost half the country\\'s population. Mr. Chew said he accepted the commerce committee\\'s invitation because he wanted to address misconceptions about TikTok, both to Congress and the American public. \"There are some things [being said] that are outright just wrong about our company, and we do need to clarify it,\" he said in the interview. In his testimony Thursday, he said TikTok acknowledged the security concerns that Congress members raised. \"Our approach has never been to dismiss or trivialize any of these concerns,\" he said. \"We have addressed them with real action.\" Rep. Frank Pallone (D., N.J.), the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, issued a blunt response to Mr. Chew\\'s claims. \"I don\\'t buy it,\" Mr. Pallone said. Write to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com', \"Ford Motor Co. plans to build 500,000 electric trucks a year at its forthcoming manufacturing complex in Tennessee, one of the auto maker's largest commitments yet to expanding battery-powered options in the highly competitive pickup-truck market . The Dearborn, Mich., car company said Friday it plans to start production of its next-generation electric truck in 2025 at a new factory campus, called Blue Oval City, located about 50 miles from Memphis. This truck will follow the rollout last year of the Ford F-150 Lightning, an all-electric version of its bestselling full-size pickup. The 500,000-truck production target for Tennessee represents a significant step up in manufacturing capacity for the company's line of pickup trucks, historically among its biggest moneymakers. Last year, Ford built about one million trucks overall at several plants in North America. It also comes as other car companies, including crosstown rival General Motors Co. and electric-vehicle leader Tesla Inc., are rushing to put out their own battery-powered trucks, filling a market niche that has seen a surge in consumer demand in recent years. Chief Executive Jim Farley said the new factory would add to Ford's existing truck-building capacity and is needed because the company expects to win over new buyers with the next-generation EV pickup. With the Lightning, 70% to 80% of customers are new to Ford, he added. Ford has twice increased production of the Lightning truck as it has worked to fill a backlog of orders. The auto maker is investing heavily to build new factories, including those that make batteries, and expand its lineup of electric offerings, pledging to produce two million EVs annually by 2026. Right now, the expenditures are becoming a drag on the company's bottom line. On Thursday, Ford said its ambitions to scale EV sales and production led to a $2.1 billion pretax loss in 2022 for its electric-vehicle unit. It projects to post a $3 billion operating loss on its EV business this year. The 3,600-acre Blue Oval City campus, which includes a battery plant and an auto assembly factory , is core to Ford's efforts to become the top seller in the electric-vehicle space, a crown long held by Tesla. Together with South Korean battery maker SK On, the two companies are spending $5.6 billion on the complex. When fully operational, it will employ about 6,000 people, the company said Friday. Mr. Farley declined to say whether workers at the Tennessee complex would be unionized, only that the decision would be up to the employees. Hourly workers at Ford's other U.S. factories are represented by the United Auto Workers union. Ford sells two other EVs now: a plug-in commercial van and the Mustang Mach-E SUV. Last year, it sold about 61,000 EVs in the U.S. The company has joined with SK to produce batteries for the Lightning truck, as well as the next-generation pickup. While sales of the F-150 Lightning have been brisk, the car company recently ran into challenges at its factory in Dearborn, Mich., where it makes the truck. Ford had to suspend production there for five weeks in February and March as it investigated an electric truck that caught fire in a holding lot. The auto maker said the root cause was an internal battery short circuit that occurred when the vehicle was at a high state of charge. It recalled 18 Lightning trucks with the defective batteries in early March and said the problem was limited to batteries built within a certain time frame. Ford is among a number of auto makers shelling out billions of dollars to build EV plants and battery factories in the U.S., a trend that has been accelerated by new incentives offered under the Inflation Reduction Act. Much of that investment is flowing to Southern states such as Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina, which have lower energy costs and more turnkey construction sites. In addition to the complex in Tennessee, Ford is building two battery factories in Kentucky with SK. Write to Nora Eckert at nora.eckert@wsj.com\", 'SEOUL—South Korea\\'s LG Energy Solution Ltd. said it would invest about $5.6 billion in a battery-manufacturing complex in Arizona, the latest in a string of new plants by foreign companies as the U.S. transitions toward cleaner fuels. LG Energy said Friday that the new battery complex in Queen Creek, Ariz., will mainly serve electric-vehicle makers in North America. The amount is about four times larger than what the firm had initially pledged when it first revealed plans last year to manufacture cylindrical batteries for electric vehicles in Arizona, though the project had been up in the air until Friday\\'s announcement. LG Energy said in June 2022 that it was reassessing its investment options due to unprecedented economic conditions. Inflation has been driving up the costs of raw materials and other expenses for manufacturers worldwide. The complex announced Friday will consist of two battery plants and mark the largest investment ever for a stand-alone battery-manufacturing facility in North America, LG Energy said. LG Energy\\'s announcement comes as battery makers have been pushing to build up a bigger production base in the U.S., which is looking to strengthen its local supply chains and reduce reliance on China while speeding up shifts to green technologies. The Biden administration\\'s Inflation Reduction Act has offered billions of dollars in tax credits for EVs sold in the U.S., but only applies if they have a certain value of their battery components assembled in North America. LG Energy said the Arizona plant will meet the eligibility requirements of the EV tax-credits program under the IRA. \"We believe it\\'s the right move at the right time in order to empower [the] clear energy transition in the U.S.,\" LG Energy Chief Executive Kwon Young-soo said. The EV tax-credits program has stoked complaints from foreign car makers, but has opened business opportunities for non-Chinese battery players including South Korea\\'s LG Energy, Samsung SDI Co. and SK On Co. as well as Japan\\'s Panasonic Holdings Corp., which have all announced plans for new manufacturing plants in the U.S., including many via joint partnership with auto makers. LG Energy is the world\\'s second-largest producer of EV batteries after China\\'s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., and has been seeking growth in the U.S. , where it has seen a boost from Washington\\'s legislation intended to subsidize clean-energy industries and to reduce economic dependence on China. When excluding China\\'s CATL, LG Energy is the top battery maker globally, accounting for 21% of the combined EV and energy-storage-system battery market by units sold last year, according to Seoul-based market-research firm SNE Research. In addition to the Arizona complex, LG Energy is working to expand its battery-manufacturing base across North America. It has three plants it has built or is building across the U.S. with General Motors Co. as well as one planned plant with Honda Motor Co. in Ohio and one with Stellantis NV in Canada. For the coming Arizona complex, the South Korean battery maker plans to spend roughly $3.2 billion on one plant for building cylindrical batteries serving electric vehicles with a production capacity of 27 gigawatt-hours. It is expected to start mass production in 2025. The remaining amount will be spent on another plant for producing lithium-iron-phosphate pouch-type batteries used for energy storage systems, with a capacity of 16 gigawatt-hours. It is expected to start mass production in 2026, according to LG Energy. Write to Jiyoung Sohn at jiyoung.sohn@wsj.com', 'Manipulation of earnings from Corporate America is on the rise, an ominous omen for the U.S. economy. That is the conclusion of new research on accounting fraud, using a technique that flagged Enron as an earnings manipulator several years before the energy company\\'s spectacular 2001 implosion. Unless you study accounting, you have likely never come across the M-Score, which is the number underlying both the Enron episode and the economywide concern now. The \"M\" is for manipulation, and uses a company\\'s financial statements to determine whether it is engaging in manipulation. Since the 1990s, the metric has been used to identify red flags at individual companies. Now Messod D. Beneish, a professor of accounting at Indiana University who developed the M-Score in the 1990s, and several co-authors have calculated an aggregate score for nearly 2,000 companies. It shows a disturbing pattern in the historical data: The probability of manipulation usually rises rapidly in the quarters before the economy tips into recession. \"We think this is a measure of misinformation in the economy,\" said Dr. Beneish. The new aggregate measure was published in a December paper, and the latest data—compiled in March and shared with The Wall Street Journal—shows that the collective probability of fraud across major companies is the highest in over 40 years. The M-Score is calculated from eight ratios on a company\\'s balance sheet, all numbers that public companies report quarterly, and comparing the ratios to earnings statements from a year earlier. For example, one of the eight metrics raises a flag if a company abruptly starts reporting more \"receivables,\" that is, more money owed to the firm but not yet paid. Another flag goes up if a company reports higher values of assets that cannot be sold, and that aren\\'t clearly identified as plants, property or equipment. A third metric looks at changes in accruals, which is when an expense has been incurred, but not yet paid. Another identifies whether companies change how much depreciation they take. There are ways for companies to manipulate all these metrics to appear profitable even when actual sales aren\\'t improving. Of course, there could be legitimate reasons for any of these. A customer might have placed a large order toward the end of the quarter, yet won\\'t pay until early in the next quarter. A drug company might have purchased a major patent, which isn\\'t easily sold. It isn\\'t a factory, but it is genuinely very valuable. But collectively, if these metrics are moving in the wrong direction, it suggests funny business. The M-Score\\'s most famous moment came when it was revealed that three years before Enron\\'s collapse , a group of students at Cornell University\\'s business school, under accounting professor Charles Lee, used Dr. Beneish\\'s model to flag that Enron \"may be a company manipulating its earnings.\" Though their report was posted online, it received little attention until after Enron\\'s collapse. The model also flagged the German payment-processor Wirecard AG . Its spectacular collapse after accounting fraud was exposed in 2020 drew comparisons with Enron. On June 17 that year, the firm was valued at $14 billion, and eight days later it filed for the equivalent of bankruptcy. Dr. Lee noted that the M-Score also flagged strange accounting at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. before an accounting scandal at the chain in 2004 . Dr. Lee, now a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, says that any of the eight metrics wouldn\\'t necessarily mean trouble. But when the score of the combined metrics is rising, it shows \"a growth company, with core businesses that are eroding, that is running out of economic steam and using aggressive accounting,\" he said. Even if the accounting is legitimate, he added, \"you may want to avoid that company.\" Similar scores have been popular in accounting since the late 1960s. There is the Altman Z-score , created in 1968 by Edward Altman, for predicting whether companies are at risk of bankruptcy, and the Dechow F-Score, from the University of Southern California\\'s Patricia Dechow, designed to predict accounting misstatements . Models such as the M-Score aren\\'t necessarily smoking guns. They will sometimes flag legitimate businesses, especially with mergers and acquisitions. Strange shifts occur when companies absorb each other. They are, though, a reason to look more closely. \"You cannot take it to court and say, \\'Look, this company has a big M-Score and must be a fraud,\\' \" said Dr. Lee. \"But statistically, this fits the profile of a manipulator.\" In aggregate, when more firms are reporting sales that haven\\'t actually been completed, declining asset quality or any of the other indicators, it likely indicates that something in the economy is beginning to go wrong. And there is no shortage of signs of strain in the economy right now. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, several high-profile banks have collapsed, manufacturing activity has slowed and home prices are declining. Still, there is reason to think that the M-Score has something to add to the traditional numbers used to take stock of economic activity. False information on balance sheets has \"real economic effects because it represents misinformation on which firms base their investment, hiring, and production decisions,\" Dr. Beneish and his co-authors—David Farber of Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis and Matthew Glendening and Kenneth Shaw, both of the University of Missouri—wrote in December. The theory is that their index might be catching distress in the stages when some companies are taking steps to try to cover it up. That is when conditions on the ground are beginning to deteriorate, but firms are continuing to report strong earnings. The stock market might behave like the corporate sector is still humming along when in reality, its earnings are increasingly buoyed by tricks. The scholars\\' aggregate index is too new to have much of a record. Financial history is littered with recession predictors that worked great using historical data that promptly failed when used to predict the future. It didn\\'t work \"out of sample,\" as statisticians would say. So, it remains to be seen how useful the aggregate M-Score will be. But if there are a lot of things on balance sheets right now that look like fraud, that is probably not a great thing. Write to Josh Zumbrun at josh.zumbrun@wsj.com', 'Hedge funds that bet on big-picture market moves have been hit with steep losses as recent bank failures upend bets that interest rates would remain elevated. The souring of the wager led some, including Maniyar Capital Advisors and Haidar Capital Management, to lose more than 20% this month. Many of the funds, which had notched big gains as rates marched steadily upward in 2022, are now flat to down for the year following a steep recent drop in Treasury yields. Trend followers, which try to take advantage of momentum in markets, also were hurt. Some macro funds sustained lesser losses. Bridgewater Associates\\'s flagship Pure Alpha fund had lost a little more than 3% in March through Friday in its higher-volatility share class, while Switzerland-based ED Capital, started by former Moore Capital Management money manager Edouard de Langlade, lost 5%, said people familiar with the firms. Overall, macro hedge funds lost an average 3.5% in the period, according to data from research firm HFR. Macro investors since late 2021 had widely been betting that stubbornly high inflation and a tight job market would cause the Federal Reserve to raise rates faster and for longer than previously expected. Instead, recent banking turmoil put a dent in rate expectations, with the yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note notching its largest weekly decline since 1987 last week. Yields fall as bond prices rise. Bonds also surged overseas. Traders say losses funds were taking on their bets against Treasurys spread to Japanese government bonds as managers unwound similar bets in efforts to curb losses. Many of the funds use leverage, or borrowed money, to amplify their bets, which can boost gains if the wagers pay off but prove costly if they sour. \"The magnitude of the losses really boils down to the fact that this was a levered trade that abruptly unwound,\" said Greg Dowling, chief investment officer of investment-consulting firm Fund Evaluation Group. In the span of some 48 hours in early March, Silicon Valley Bank\\'s collapse changed investors\\' expectations about the path of interest rates in the U.S., Mr. Dowling said. Where investors previously expected that the Federal Reserve would continue to raise rates, they suddenly were confronted with the possibility that the central bank would ease up, fearing a banking crisis could tip the U.S. economy into recession. Such regime shifts are usually accompanied by months of changing data and messaging from the Fed. The Fed on Wednesday approved a quarter-percentage-point rate increase but signaled it might be done tightening sooner than previously expected, causing Treasury yields to slip further. London-based Maniyar, a macro hedge fund partly owned by Paul Tudor Jones, lost 22% for the month through Friday, according to people familiar with the firm. Haidar\\'s Jupiter fund, which gained 193% in 2022, lost 32% for the period, said a person familiar with the firm. Bloomberg News earlier reported Haidar\\'s loss. Among trend followers, which also profited by betting on higher rates last year, the Tactical Trend fund of the $18 billion Graham Capital Management lost about 10% for the month through Friday, said people familiar with the firm. Stockholm-based Lynx Asset Management\\'s diversified trend-following strategy, the Lynx Program, also lost roughly 10% for the period. Rob Christian, investment chief at K2 Advisors, a Franklin Templeton unit that invests more than $10 billion of client money in hedge funds, said some giveback of outsize gains was to be expected for trend followers, officially known as commodity trading advisers. \"I always tell people you have to have an iron stomach to invest in CTAs,\" he said. A rare fund that profited is $1 billion Key Square Capital Management, based in Greenwich, Conn. In a March 13 investor letter, founder Scott Bessent, a former investment chief for George Soros, wrote that Key Square the prior week had increased its funds\\' exposures to gold and haven currencies, shorted bank stocks and pulled back on energy exposure. Mr. Bessent since late last year had warned his clients that banks could face losses in their fixed-income and structured-products portfolios. A person familiar with the firm said Key Square\\'s main hedge fund was up 2.5% for the month through Friday. Another fund employing more leverage had gained 5%.', 'TOKYO -- Toshiba Corp. said it agreed to a $15 billion deal to take the company private, a move that would end years of conflict with foreign shareholders and put the company under full Japanese control. Toshiba said the buyout would be led by Japan Industrial Partners Inc., a Tokyo-based investment fund, and would include 17 domestic companies and six banks. A former leader of Japan\\'s corporate world, Toshiba has gone through eight years of turmoil that started with an accounting scandal in 2015 and included the 2017 bankruptcy filing by its U.S. nuclear subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric Co. It has sold many of the businesses that made it a well-known name globally, including laptop computers, televisions and medical equipment. Its remaining businesses include energy systems, batteries and air conditioners. Toshiba has been under strong pressure from overseas investors to consider privatization. Foreign investors took a bigger role in 2017 when they injected billions of dollars to improve Toshiba\\'s balance sheet. However, the buyout offer price is well below what those investors thought they could get a year or two ago, when the stock market was giving higher valuations to semiconductor manufacturers and other technology businesses in which Toshiba is active. Toshiba said the buyers were offering 4,620 yen a share, about 10% above the closing price of 4,213 yen in Tokyo Stock Exchange trading Thursday. That values the company at about 2 trillion yen, equivalent to $15 billion. The offer price was lower than the 5,000 yen a share CVC Capital Partners was informally offering in April 2021 -- a price that some Toshiba shareholders at the time said was too low. That potential deal fell apart as Toshiba said CVC\\'s proposal lacked details. For the nine months to December, Toshiba reported its net profit dropped 27% to the equivalent of about $640 million. Toshiba said the buyout group led by Japan Industrial Partners repeatedly lowered its offer price in recent months as market conditions and Toshiba\\'s business performance worsened. It said this situation \"is not something to instigate doubts about the fairness of the negotiation process\" and doesn\\'t refute the board\\'s position that it exerted itself to get the best possible deal for shareholders. Toshiba said that while the board unanimously agreed to accept the buyout proposal, the price wasn\\'t high enough to make an immediate recommendation to shareholders on whether they should sell their shares to the buyout group. It said a special committee would discuss whether to make a recommendation to shareholders. One of Toshiba\\'s main assets is the stake it retained in its memory-chip business after it sold majority control in 2018. That business, now a company called Kioxia Holdings Corp., had planned an initial public offering that would have been a lucrative opportunity for Toshiba to cash out, but Kioxia put off the IPO after a chip shortage turned into a glut. In March 2022, Toshiba shareholders rejected a management plan to split the company into two parts, reflecting opposition from foreign shareholders including some that wanted the company to be auctioned to the highest bidder. The next month Toshiba put itself up for auction. Seeking to bring foreign shareholders into the auction process, Toshiba added representatives from major U.S.-based shareholders Elliott Management Corp. and Farallon Capital Management LLC to its board. Toshiba received multiple buyout proposals, but it said Japan Industrial Partners was the only bidder with a detailed and workable plan. It said the formal takeover offer was expected to begin in late July pending approval for the acquisition under global competition laws. It said the offer would succeed if more than two-thirds of shareholders agree to sell their shares.', 'With Washington and Beijing embroiled in an intensifying great-power competition, multinational companies increasingly find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Ahead of this weekend\\'s China Development Forum in Beijing, the mood among the more than 50 chief executives and other senior executives from the U.S. and other countries expected to attend the high-level conference was a mix of anxiety and caution, said people close to the event. Their apprehension reflects the further deterioration of a relationship that for years has been mutually beneficial: that between Beijing and multinationals. For U.S. executives, the stakes of being seen hobnobbing in Beijing are extra high as Washington-Beijing ties fray ever further and just days after U.S. lawmakers pummeled the CEO of Chinese-owned TikTok about potential Chinese government influence on the platform. For many executives, though, the forum is the first opportunity to check out their China operations since Beijing ended nearly three years of Covid-19 isolation —and to get face time with the new Communist Party leadership recently installed under third-term leader Xi Jinping. Against the backdrop of increased animosity, though, many corporate participants in the China forum plan to keep a low profile, the people close to the event said. According to a list compiled by the forum\\'s organizers and viewed by The Wall Street Journal, the expected attendees include tech-giant chief executives Tim Cook of Apple Inc. and Cristiano Amon of Qualcomm Inc., and such consumer-goods and pharmaceuticals CEOs as Johnson & Johnson\\'s Joaquin Duato, Pfizer Inc.\\'s Albert Bourla, Procter & Gamble Co.\\'s Jon Moeller and Abbott Laboratories\\' Robert Ford. Ola Källenius, chairman of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, and Oliver Zipse, chairman of BMW AG, are also on the list. So are CEOs of energy companies including Wael Sawan of Shell PLC, Gary Nagle of Glencore PLC and Jakob Stausholm of Rio Tinto PLC. The expected attendance of Messrs. Cook, Bourla and Källenius were previously reported by The Wall Street Journal. Representatives for the companies declined to comment or didn\\'t respond to requests for comment. The organizer of the conference didn\\'t immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing has been holding the China Development Forum annually since 2000 to bring together global business elites and the country\\'s policy makers and to attract and keep foreign investment. During the U.S.-China trade war, Beijing used the forum to encourage corporate participants to lobby Washington on its behalf. This year\\'s forum, to be held at its usual venue of the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, comes as Washington steps up sanctions against Chinese companies and Beijing increases pressure on multinationals to not cross any lines that clash with Chinese positions, such as by declining to use cotton from the Xinjiang region —where the U.S. says Muslims are forced to work in internment camps. China has denied forced-labor practices. Some attending this year\\'s forum are scheduled to meet with Li Qiang, the newly appointed Chinese premier, at the Great Hall of the People on Monday afternoon. An unidentified vice premier is expected to give a keynote address on Sunday, according to the forum\\'s schedule viewed by the Journal. Most if not all of the Western corporate participants plan to avoid public engagements for fear of saying anything that might offend either Beijing or Washington, the people close to the event said. \"Trying to get lost in the crowd is not a bad approach,\" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, who will be attending the forum. But Mr. Kennedy said he expects many CEOs to privately impress upon the Chinese officials that \"the risks for Western firms of operating in China are higher than ever.\" Relations between the U.S. and China, the world\\'s leading economic powers, are already strained over trade, Taiwan, technology and geopolitical rivalries. On Thursday, TikTok landed in the middle of it as U.S. lawmakers leveled withering attacks at the app\\'s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, in a hearing that lasted more than five hours. The Biden administration has threatened to ban the app if ByteDance Ltd., its Chinese owner, doesn\\'t sell its holdings. Hours before Mr. Chew\\'s hearing, Beijing said it opposes a TikTok sale . More Western companies are reassessing their operations in China as tensions between Beijing and Washington rise. In addition, China\\'s nearly three years of draconian Covid-19 restrictions, followed by a sudden and chaotic dismantling of the curbs late in 2022, disrupted supplies of goods from a country known as the world\\'s factory floor. In a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China of 319 of its members, only 45% of respondents said they regard China as their primary or among their top three investment destinations , down from 59% in 2019. Some senior economic officials in Beijing have also grown worried about losing foreign investors as the government is trying to reboot an economy battered by the China\\'s self-imposed Covid-19 isolation . For instance, Liu He, until recently Mr. Xi\\'s right-hand economic czar, expressed such concerns to some Western executives at the World Economic Forum\\'s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, in January. Also on the list of those attending this year\\'s China forum are Ray Dalio, founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates; Howard Marks, co-chairman of distressed-debt manager Oaktree Capital; and Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara, CEO of Singaporean sovereign-wealth fund Temasek Holdings. Bridgewater and Oaktree didn\\'t respond to a request for comment. A Temasek spokesperson confirmed its CEO\\'s attendance. \"As an institution, we take part in forums globally for insights on the latest developments, and to exchange views with other investors and stakeholders,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. While expressing desire to keep attracting foreign investment, Beijing has appeared to continue its pressure on multinationals. Earlier this month, for instance, it suspended the operations of Deloitte\\'s Beijing office for three months and imposed an unprecedented fine, totaling about $31 million, over alleged lapses in its auditing work of state-owned China Huarong Asset Management Co. By comparison, Huarong itself and seven of its subsidiaries were fined about $14,500 each. Deloitte said it respected the penalty decision. Sharon Thorne, global board chair of Deloitte, is listed as a participant in the China forum. Write to Lingling Wei at Lingling.Wei@wsj.com', 'WASHINGTON -- U.S.-China relations were rocked again Thursday as House lawmakers pummeled TikTok\\'s chief executive over the popular app\\'s ties to China, and as Beijing said it would fight any U.S. attempt to force the company\\'s sale by its Chinese owners. The congressional hearing, peppered with withering attacks on TikTok from both Democrats and Republicans, ran more than five hours and underscored increasing concerns over Beijing\\'s potential influence over the app. It comes as relations between the U.S. and China are frayed over trade, Taiwan, technology and geopolitical rivalries. TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew, seated in front of U.S. TikTok executives and popular stars on the platform, sought to reassure lawmakers that TikTok would earn their trust. \"Our approach has never been to dismiss or trivialize any of these concerns. We have addressed them with real action,\" he said. Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, gave a blunt response to Mr. Chew\\'s claims. \"I don\\'t buy it,\" Mr. Pallone said. The committee\\'s Republican chairwoman, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, called for banning the app, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. The bipartisan skepticism further clouded the future of a platform that TikTok has said is used by 150 million people in the U.S. Hours before the hearing, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would \"firmly oppose\" the Biden administration\\'s recent demand that TikTok\\'s Chinese owners sell their stakes or face a ban. U.S. lawmakers pointed to that statement as evidence that the company was beholden to Beijing. TikTok\\'s travails have put it at the center of fraying ties between the world\\'s two great economic powers as they quarrel over trade policy, surveillance, technological development and more. Washington stepped up sanctions against Chinese companies and Beijing deployed regulatory enforcement and other pressure tactics against U.S. businesses. The resulting trade blacklists have swept up China-based telecommunications companies Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., as well as U.S. defense contractors Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Technologies Corp. \"The TikTok battles are indicative of the end of an era,\" said Lindsay Gorman, senior fellow for emerging technologies at the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, and a former Biden White House adviser. \"This era where U.S.-China business relations can continue absent considerations of geopolitics is over.\" The U.S.\\'s concerns over TikTok partly stem from increased involvement in business activities by the Chinese government. Under President Xi Jinping, China\\'s party-state adopted laws and regulations to ensure its access to data collected by private firms and expanded efforts to influence corporate governance and decision making. China blocked U.S. social media and information sites including Alphabet Inc.\\'s Google and Meta Platforms Inc.\\'s Facebook. A fund backed by China\\'s cybersecurity watchdog holds a 1% stake in the core subsidiary of TikTok\\'s Chinese parent, ByteDance, a so-called golden share that gives the regulator a board seat at the subsidiary, voting power and sway over its business decisions. Under questioning from Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R., Texas), Mr. Chew said that under the company\\'s security plan, TikTok\\'s data would be stored in the U.S. and controlled by a U.S. company. Mr. Crenshaw responded: \"I want to say this to all the teenagers out there and TikTok influencers who think we\\'re just old and out of touch and . . . . trying to take away your favorite app. You may not care that your data is being accessed now, but it will be one day when you do care about it.\" Mrs. Rodgers opened the questioning Thursday by asking Mr. Chew to state \"with 100% certainty\" that the Chinese government couldn\\'t use TikTok or its parent company, ByteDance, to surveil Americans or manipulate the content Americans see. Mr. Chew said TikTok is committed to firewalling U.S. user data from \"all unwanted foreign access\" and would keep content \"free from any manipulation from any government.\" \"If you can\\'t say it 100% certain, I take that as a \\'no,\\'\" Mrs. Rodgers shot back. \"I have zero confidence in your assertion that ByteDance and TikTok are not beholden\" to the Chinese Communist Party. In his testimony, Mr. Chew said TikTok is spending $1.5 billion to create the firewall, leaving \"American data stored on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel.\" When that process is complete, he said, it should eliminate lawmakers\\' concern that some TikTok user data could be subject to Chinese law -- though he said engineers globally could access it as required for business purposes. Asked about a possible sale, Mr. Chew said he doesn\\'t think a change in ownership would improve safety and security, pointing to the privacy problems of U.S. tech platforms. He said the platform would work to ensure a safe environment for young people, another concern of committee members. Rep. Bob Latta (R., Ohio) said TikTok had been insulated from legal claims arising from the death of a 10-year-old girl who participated in a breath-holding challenge that was popular on TikTok. Mr. Latta questioned why TikTok should be protected by federal law shielding websites when it amplifies \"dangerous and life-threatening content to children.\" Mr. Chew said the platform has taken a number of proactive steps to better protect children -- including measures that go beyond those employed by other platforms. For example, accounts registered to teens under 16 are set to private by default, and they can\\'t send direct messages. Their content is ineligible for recommendation in the app\\'s popular \"For You\" tab. He said dealing with harmful content was an industrywide challenge. Some lawmakers asked Mr. Chew if he agreed that China\\'s government has persecuted the Uyghur ethnic group, which U.S. officials have characterized as a genocide. Mr. Chew answered by saying content about that issue was available on TikTok. After the hearing ended, TikTok spokeswoman Brooke Oberwetter said in a statement that political grandstanding had dominated the hearing, ignoring the solutions TikTok was working on to protect user data and keep content harmful to young people off the site. The hearing shed little light on how Congress might address the numerous problems with TikTok that lawmakers highlighted. Several bills are under consideration in Congress that would ban TikTok outright, typically by banning U.S. companies from doing business with it. Some would allow the government to ban or restrict other apps with ties to hostile foreign governments. Several lawmakers urged renewed consideration of comprehensive privacy legislation. A ban on TikTok faces practical and legal hurdles, and two federal judges struck down former President Donald Trump\\'s earlier attempts to do so. Any crackdown carries political risks, particularly for Democrats who tend to get more support from the younger people who are TikTok\\'s dominant audience. --- Lingling Wei, Stu Woo, Grace Zhu and Raffaele Huang contributed to this article.', 'Electric vehicles are taking General Motors Co.\\'s cyber chief into new territory. Kevin Tierney, the auto maker\\'s chief cybersecurity officer, often finds himself monitoring risks across information-technology systems, autonomous vehicles and manufacturing plants. Now, he\\'s adding power-grid security to his day-to-day work. His added brief is mostly due to the sweeping shift away from gas-powered cars. California, among several states, has mandated zero-emission vehicles by 2035, and GM is significantly upgrading its EV production capacity, including with a $650 million investment in Lithium Americas Corp. as part of a plan to develop a mine in Nevada and secure access to a mineral key to the batteries used in EVs. The company plans to release several new electric models this year, and aims to install thousands of charging stations across the U.S. by 2025. \"We\\'re moving, really, from just being a vehicle manufacturer to a vehicle manufacturer and infrastructure provider,\" Mr. Tierney said. That, in turn, creates new cyber risks. Research funded by the Energy Department, published in July, found that hackers could use vulnerable security at charging stations to skim credit-card details and even hijack entire charging networks. Hackers have shown a willingness to target the U.S. power grid, and a string of physical attacks have also disrupted operations. The cyber vulnerabilities of EV and energy security have gained attention in Washington. In October, the Office of the National Cyber Director held a meeting on the subject of EV security. The U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources hosted a hearing Thursday on cybersecurity in the energy sector. On Tuesday, Mr. Tierney was appointed to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s cybersecurity advisory committee, a group of private-sector specialists from companies across critical infrastructure operators that advises CISA Director Jen Easterly. Mr. Tierney said public-private partnerships designed to draw on specialists across sectors will be critical. Given that GM\\'s operations cross into advanced manufacturing, transportation and now energy distribution, he said, cyber resilience means companies need to cooperate on core issues. \"I think we have to figure out a little bit better, across sectors, where our touch points are and where we can make our forces more cumulative, instead of maybe doing the same things over and over again,\" he said.', 'WASHINGTON -- Top progressive Democrats said they have disagreements with President Biden but remain staunch supporters headed into the 2024 election, after moves by the administration on issues such as crime, immigration and energy policy angered the party\\'s left wing. Mr. Biden sided with Republicans on overturning Washington, D.C.\\'s crime code, prompting howls from progressives for stepping on home rule, and the White House has drawn scrutiny for considering a return to a policy of detaining migrant families who cross illegally into the U.S. The administration also approved the Willow oil-drilling project in the Alaskan Arctic over the objections of environmentalists. Progressive lawmakers and activists criticized the moves, but the blowback has been limited. No major protests have emerged outside the White House, and there has been no talk of a serious primary challenger from the progressive flank. Many see Mr. Biden as critical to winning the coming presidential race and helping take back full control of Congress, even if they aren\\'t always on the same page. \"I\\'m opposed to the Willow project, which will mean fossil-fuel drilling on federal land, and I do think the president will need to have a bold climate policy to mobilize young voters in 2024,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), a progressive who is considering running for Senate next year. Still, on the presidential race, Mr. Khanna said: \"I\\'ll be backing him enthusiastically.\" Progressives have been the loudest voices within the party on matters including policing, LGBT issues, economic opportunity and protecting the environment. Mr. Biden ran in 2020 as a seasoned centrist but has worked with progressives on many of their priorities -- including passing a bill designed to slow climate change and taking executive action to trim student loans. \"It\\'s no secret that the president wasn\\'t my first choice in 2020,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.) who leads the House progressives. But after working together she plans to support him in 2024. She said progressives will continue to \"push where we need to push.\" A recent NBC/PBS NewsHour poll said that 50% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents think Democrats have a better chance of winning the White House if Mr. Biden is the nominee, compared with 45% who think the party would do better with someone else. Mr. Biden is expected to formally announce he is running later this year. The White House said it is in regular touch with progressive leaders on Capitol Hill. With House Democrats now in the minority, progressives are pressuring Mr. Biden to take more executive actions, bypassing Congress. Staff for the Congressional Progressive Caucus met with the White House\\'s Office of Legislative Affairs on Tuesday to talk about their wish list, which includes a range of demands, from expanding worker overtime protections to declaring a national climate emergency. Last year, progressives pressed Mr. Biden to cancel student loan debt. Ultimately Mr. Biden issued an executive order to cancel up to $20,000 in debt, short of what some progressives wanted. The Supreme Court is expected to decide the fate of the program by late June. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) both ran against Mr. Biden in the 2020 Democratic primary, proposing student-loan forgiveness and expanded government health coverage. They now back Mr. Biden if he seeks another term. \"I think what the progressive movement in the country has done is to show the political establishment that millions of people are tired of status quo politics,\" said Mr. Sanders. \"Is he doing everything that I would like? No, but I think he has heard that message,\" he said. \"I thought they were wrong,\" Ms. Warren said of the president\\'s recent moves on immigration, drilling and crime, while praising his actions on climate and corporate taxes. \"Joe Biden and I don\\'t agree on everything, but I\\'m really glad he\\'s president of the U.S.,\" she said on NBC News. The White House cited Mr. Biden\\'s recently released budget, which proposes child care, paid leave and free community college, as showing shared goals. But the White House is also trying to take a tough line on issues such as crime and illegal immigration that Republicans make clear will be a focus in 2024.', 'Virginia-based power company AES Corp. says it is ready to push the button on a solar-panel order of more than $1 billion if a manufacturer will commit to building a factory in the U.S. If that factory gets built, AES can buy its panels and apply for federal subsidies recently made available to clean-energy developers that use equipment made in the U.S. There is one problem: The government hasn\\'t decided what \"made in the U.S.\" means, and how strictly to define it. \"You can\\'t sign on the dotted line until this is clarified,\" said Andres Gluski, AES\\'s chief executive. The company and two other developers have said they would collectively buy as much as $6 billion in panels from a manufacturer that sets up in the U.S. Just what qualifies as made in America is one of the biggest questions still hanging over the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed in August that offers hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits and other incentives for clean-energy projects. The issue is more complicated than it might seem, given that almost all clean-energy projects require at least some parts that are manufactured overseas. The law is supposed to spur not only the deployment of clean energy but also the creation of domestic jobs and industries to underpin that rollout. So lawmakers sprinkled support for U.S.-made products throughout the legislation -- from rebates for buying electric vehicles that contain significant domestic content to bonus tax credits for solar or wind developers that use enough U.S.-manufactured equipment. \"If we\\'re going to use federal tax dollars, we\\'re going to direct that investment into the United States and create American jobs,\" said John Podesta, senior adviser to President Biden for clean-energy innovation and implementation, at a Houston energy conference in early March. \"We\\'ve for too long let our supply chains drift overseas, particularly to China.\" As much as half of potentially $500 billion-plus in investment generated by the Inflation Reduction Act\\'s incentives include some sort of domestic-content requirements or bonus, according to an analysis by research institute Rhodium Group. The money at stake has made defining what it would take to meet those requirements one of the most hotly contested aspects of the law, spurring complaints from governments as well as tussles among companies ranging from U.S. steelmaker Nucor Corp. to power company NextEra Energy Inc. -- all of which are angling for as much of the green subsidies as possible. The details are being completed by the Treasury Department and are expected to come out over the next few months. The rules on one important incentive -- a $7,500 tax rebate for electric-vehicle purchases, if the cars and their batteries meet domestic content and sourcing requirements -- are expected by the end of this month. Meanwhile, many would-be investors are hanging back. In solar, wind and storage projects alone, about $20 billion in investment could be on hold while the government sorts out a variety of tax-credit details, say clean-energy analysts. A big challenge is that much of the manufacturing the law is trying to spur barely exists in the U.S. today, from the silicon ingots and special glass needed for solar panels to the large steel plates for offshore wind arrays. The bulk of those products and components are instead imported from overseas, particularly China. Defining \"made in America\" in a way that excludes most of those imports could mean nobody would meet domestic-content requirements, some green-energy developers say. Take solar projects, which under the legislation could in some cases receive 10% more in bonus tax credits if enough of the equipment by value is made domestically. That incentive has sparked a furious debate over solar panels, which alone can comprise 40% of the total equipment cost of a solar plant and are crucial to getting the bonus. Companies such as NextEra, the U.S.\\'s biggest developer of solar projects, are urging that panels assembled in the U.S. be considered American-made, even if the ingredients come from overseas. Such a definition would let more developers get bonus credits and encourage the construction of more solar farms, they reason. Companies such as South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group\\'s Qcells unit, which is planning a U.S. factory, disagree. A solar panel shouldn\\'t be defined as U.S.-made if its most important pieces are made overseas, Hanwha said.', 'CAIRO -- After years of underinvestment in North Africa\\'s energy infrastructure, global oil-and-gas giants from Halliburton Co. and Chevron Corp. to Eni SpA are ramping up their presence in the region as demand from Europe grows. Executives in the industry are betting it is worth drilling again in some of the hardest places to do business in the world as Europe increasingly turns to other sources for its energy needs after shunning its main supplier, Russia, over the invasion of Ukraine. In recent months, a string of European officials have visited the region to help advance talks over potential supply deals. Halliburton and Honeywell International Inc. are hammering out $1.4 billion worth of deals to develop an oil field and refinery with National Oil Corporation in Libya, which has the largest known oil reserves in Africa, according to the chairman of the state-owned firm, Farhat Bengdara. Italy\\'s Eni is planning investments aimed at replacing nearly half of the gas it was importing from Russia with gas from Algeria. Chevron is looking to seal an energy exploration deal in Algeria, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. In January, the U.S. oil major announced a sizable natural-gas discovery in Egypt. \"North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,\" said Geoff Porter, president of U.S.-based North Africa Risk Consulting Inc. But with Europe needing to replace Russian energy, \"this is their moment,\" he said. Western oil executives say they see a more stable political climate in North Africa, especially in countries such as Libya, where fighting between local militias has been subdued in the past two years following nearly a decade of civil war. Many U.S. firms had pulled back from the region, viewing it as politically too risky, to focus on shale production at home. The region\\'s proximity to Europe and massive reserves, with Algeria holding the third-largest recoverable shale resources in the world, also make doing business there worth the risk, they say. At the same time, state-owned firms in the North African region have been eager to strike deals, as they see an opportunity to fill a gap left by Russia and take advantage of higher global commodity prices. Some countries, such as Egypt, are eager to bring in additional revenue from selling energy, as their economies struggle with higher import costs including for food. The Ukraine war has disrupted shipments and pushed up global commodity prices. The Libyan state-owned company is expected to soon sign a $1 billion agreement with Halliburton that will allow the U.S. firm to rebuild the al-Dhara oil field, according to Mr. Bengdara. The oil field in central Libya was destroyed by Islamic State militants in 2015 and is now run by ConocoPhillips and TotalEnergies SE, he said. It would be one of the biggest deals for the U.S. oil-services giant clinched in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years. Halliburton and Total didn\\'t respond to requests to comment. ConocoPhillips declined to comment. Libya\\'s NOC and Honeywell are set to unveil a contract related to the construction of a refinery in southern Libya, Mr. Bengdara and a spokesman for the American firm said. The initial deal, expected to be announced this weekend, is for the design of the plant, the spokesman said, which would be followed by a $400 million pact to build the entire plant. Libya relies heavily on its oil resources for income, although it has struggled for years to turn its own crude into motor fuel, making it largely dependent on costly gasoline imports. --- William Mauldin contributed to this article.', 'When Yolett McPhee-McCuin saw the Mississippi women\\'s basketball coaching job was open in 2018, she didn\\'t wait for a call. She reached out to the school\\'s search firm and sold herself. \"I\\'m hot,\" she said. \"And y\\'all could get me for cheap.\" McPhee-McCuin had turned around Jacksonville University\\'s team from several losing seasons to 24-9. Ole Miss had little to lose, having won exactly one Southeastern Conference game the season before. Five years later, McPhee-McCuin and her No. 8-seeded Rebels engineered one of the NCAA women\\'s tournament\\'s biggest upsets, beating perennial power and No. 1 seed Stanford on Sunday. The Rebels face No. 5 Louisville on Friday in the Sweet 16. While women\\'s college basketball has been dominated by dynastic coaches or those who\\'ve played in the Olympics, McPhee-McCuin is \"out of the mud,\" she said. She grew up in the Caribbean nation of the Bahamas, whose entire national population of 408,000 wouldn\\'t quite fill the stands over an eight-game home season of Ole Miss football. McPhee-McCuin had an unremarkable college career -- Miami-Dade Community College, followed by Rhode Island -- then clambered up a splintery coaching ladder to become the reigning NCAA women\\'s tournament darling. McPhee-McCuin\\'s route included crisscrossing the U.S. to unglamorous assistant jobs: a junior college in the Texas panhandle city of Borger, nicknamed \"Booger Town\"; Arkansas-Pine Bluff; the University of Portland (Ore.); Pittsburgh; and Clemson before landing her first head coaching job, at Jacksonville. \"I always use, like, basketball analogies, and I say: For my life, y\\'all, I never get a wide-open layup,\" McPhee-McCuin said. \"I always have to do a pro-hop or a Euro step to score in life.\" Coach Yo, as she\\'s known, had a knack for connecting with people, though -- precious currency in the player recruitment that drives college basketball. She told the Coach JB Show podcast this week: \"I don\\'t know that I\\'m ever going to be googly-eyes over the McDonald\\'s All-American. Give me the Wendy\\'s All-American all day, every day.\" It was a journey to an actual fast-food restaurant that helped land one of her most important recruits. Kayla Gordon, a standout at Meridian (Miss.) High in the early 2010s, recalled that she was a homebody with no interest in leaving the state. But Coach Yo wanted her on the team in Jacksonville, about an eight-hour drive away. So one day, McPhee-McCuin surprised Gordon by walking into the Chick-fil-A where she worked. As the two chatted, Gordon said she marveled at the steps McPhee-McCuin had taken: Calling her mom to find out when she was working, making the trip, showing up and showing Gordon how much she valued her. \"I\\'m like, \\'Wow, I feel special,\\'\" Gordon recalled. Gordon played four years at Jacksonville, leading the team in rebounding her senior year. After school she took two more leaps inspired by Coach Yo: The former homebody went to Europe, playing professionally in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Finland. And Gordon went into coaching. She\\'s now an assistant women\\'s basketball coach at Jacksonville. Ross Bjork, the Ole Miss athletic director in 2018, said that Coach Yo was on Mississippi\\'s list of potential women\\'s basketball coaches -- a list 25 people long. As he interviewed candidates, said Bjork, now Texas A&M\\'s athletic director, a representative of the search firm hired by the school reminded him, \"Hey, don\\'t forget about Coach Yo.\" That representative, now TurnkeyZRG managing director Chad Chatlos, said McPhee-McCuin was, \"just was like a bulldog: \\'Put me in front of the AD. I won\\'t let you down.\\' Yolett just had this perfect blend of being aggressive but being respectful of the process.\" Bjork and an Ole Miss colleague finally set up a FaceTime call with McPhee-McCuin and, Bjork said, \"She, like, jumped through the screen with her energy and passion.\" Coach Yo was also fearless, something he needed in a coach coming into a tough conference for a rebuilding job. McPhee-McCuin muddled through two rough seasons -- 9-22, 7-23 -- before pushing Ole Miss above .500 in 2021, then to the NCAA tournament\\'s first round in 2022. This season, the Rebels narrowly lost against SEC power LSU and defending NCAA champion South Carolina. Then came the second-round NCAA upset of Stanford and a spontaneous celebration by all the people who\\'ve been in Coach Yo\\'s orbit.

Ole Miss forward Madison Scott recalled that Coach Yo had said the key to beating the Cardinal on their court -- the women\\'s tournament awards higher-seeded teams with early-round home games -- was improving on the Rebels\\' shooting from the line, a dismal 67.3% this season. \"Before we left, we were in Oxford (Miss.) shooting free throws every day before practice, after practice,\" Scott said.

Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled on Wednesday that utility bondholders\\' collateral rights don\\'t extend to the current and future revenue of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa. Bondholders were deemed to have a security interest only in certain funds in Prepa\\'s reserve accounts, which represent a fraction of their claims. Judge Swain said that bondholders have only an unsecured claim to the utility\\'s future net revenue, or its excess funds after operating expenses are paid. Further proceedings are needed to value that unsecured claim, which covers the future revenue that would have become payable to bondholders over the life of Prepa\\'s $8.3 billion in municipal debt, according to the decision. Wednesday\\'s ruling grants some legal leverage to the oversight board steering Puerto Rico\\'s finances as it tries to lift the power utility out of a bankruptcy case that began in 2017. The oversight board spokesman said Wednesday it welcomed the decision as \"a significant win for Puerto Rico and its path to reliable electricity and economic growth.\" \"The oversight board is still analyzing the decision in detail to determine the implications of bondholders\\' remaining claim but will continue to work on resolving the remaining issues of Prepa\\'s debt restructuring consensually,\" the spokesman said. A spokesman for Prepa bondholders declined to comment. A bondholder group had argued in court that its security interest covered the full principal and interest amounts due on their bonds and extended to Prepa\\'s current and future net revenue. Bank lenders owed $700 million and a single bond insurer, MBIA Inc., agreed to restructuring terms for Prepa, but most bondholders haven\\'t. The oversight board has offered a baseline recovery of 50 cents on the dollar to bondholders in the form of cash and new securities, or less than that if they litigate their security interests and lose. The restructuring terms will determine how much 1.5 million residential and business customers will pay for electricity, which costs more in Puerto Rico than in any U.S. state. Energy bills are already a drain on family incomes and quality of life in Puerto Rico and are expected to increase to pay for any long-term settlement of Prepa\\'s debts. The oversight board and bondholders disagreed on how much of a rate increase customers can afford, especially those with lower incomes. Bondholders have argued that Prepa has a history of underestimating its projected sales and of viewing temporary challenges, such as the rise in oil prices, as permanent in order to drive down creditors\\' claims. Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com', 'DUBAI—Saudi Arabia and Syria are nearing an agreement to restore diplomatic ties after negotiations mediated by Russia, according to Saudi and Syrian officials familiar with the discussions, as the geopolitics of the Middle East shift. Talks were continuing after rounds of discussions in Moscow and Riyadh in recent weeks, the officials said. If a deal is reached, it would mark an important step to reintegrating Syria and its leader Bashar al-Assad into the broader region after a brutal civil war . Following the Chinese-brokered deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran on resuming ties this month, the emerging Damascus-Riyadh rapprochement, if it sticks, would leave the U.S. on the sidelines again on another major Middle East development . Saudi and Syrian officials said negotiators are aiming to conclude a deal before a potential visit by Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan to Damascus after the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr in late April. But they cautioned that the discussions could still break down. Saudi state television reported Thursday night that negotiations have started with Syria to resume offering necessary consular services for both countries, citing a source at the foreign ministry. Saudi Arabia and Syria cut ties in 2012 over Mr. Assad\\'s response to political protests that emerged from the Arab Spring uprising and his actions in the ensuing civil war. The Saudis helped orchestrate Syria\\'s ejection from the Arab League and funded rebels fighting Mr. Assad\\'s forces for years. The Russian government brokered a preliminary agreement when Mr. Assad visited Moscow last week, said officials from Saudi Arabia, Syria and other Arab countries involved. Senior Syrian officials then visited Saudi Arabia in recent weeks. If a formal agreement is reached, a vote on reintegration of Syria into the broader region and its reconstruction will be on the agenda of the next Arab League summit expected in May in Saudi Arabia, according to Arab officials. Much of the Arab world has moved to set aside the rivalries that plunged the region into chaos following uprisings that began in 2011 and toppled several Middle Eastern governments. Mr. Assad has been in talks with several Arab countries to end more than a decade of isolation, and the Saudi foreign minister recently said the status quo with Syria wasn\\'t sustainable. Iran also encouraged Syria to strike a deal with Saudi Arabia after Riyadh and Tehran agreed to resume diplomatic ties after a seven-year hiatus, said an Iranian official and Syrian government advisers. Other Arab countries such as Oman and Jordan have also backed the rapprochement between Damascus and Riyadh, said Arab officials familiar with the talks. The main focus of the talks has been security, Syrian government advisers said. The kingdom wants to resolve the issue of Saudi detainees who were captured after joining jihadist groups involved in the civil war, these people said. Damascus is seeking Riyadh\\'s help to cut off funding for and recruitment of fundamentalist factions fighting in Syria, the officials said. Any agreement between Saudi Arabia and Syria, brokered by Russia, would represent another splashy diplomatic move by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The 37-year-old who rules the oil-rich kingdom day-to-day for his aging father, King Salman, has reset relations with Washington , long the Saudi\\'s protector in the Persian Gulf, and developed closer relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping since the beginning of the Ukraine war. Prince Mohammed faced diplomatic isolation for several years after Saudi agents killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in an operation that the U.S. intelligence community concluded was ordered by the royal . The Saudi government says that Prince Mohammed wasn\\'t involved and that the perpetrators were brought to justice. Prince Mohammed has tried to avoid being pulled onto any one side since the start of the Ukraine war . He has used the war as an opportunity to forge an independent foreign policy that leverages Saudi Arabia\\'s status as the world\\'s largest oil exporter. The Syria talks come after Prince Mohammed greenlighted a detente with Iran in a deal brokered by China. \"Oil exporters and authoritarian states have more in common than the democratic West, with their use of sanctions and perceived hypocrisy on respect for sovereignty,\" said Karen Young, senior research scholar specializing in the Middle East at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. In the Middle East, she said, \"the general trend is a consensus on noninterference in domestic affairs as a principle.\" Mediating between Saudi Arabia and Syria bolsters Russia\\'s presence in the Middle East. Mr. Putin\\'s air-power intervention in the Syrian civil war proved decisive for Mr. Assad, and he has courted the Saudis, aligning oil-rich Russia with the Riyadh-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. For the U.S., the deal is a reminder that, while it remains the pre-eminent military and diplomatic force in the Middle East, its influence there is waning. The U.S. still has troops in Syria, where they are conducting antiterrorism operations in the country\\'s southeast and with Kurdish-led forces in the northeast. But Washington has long signaled that it wants to focus more on Russia and China and less on the region\\'s messy affairs, and the shift was illustrated Thursday when The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. will send aging attack planes to the Middle East and swap out the more advanced combat aircraft there now. \"The most important single factor affecting the region is the perception of American withdrawal, which creates a vacuum that other countries can step into,\" said William Wechsler, a former U.S. Defense Department official and now director of the Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs in Washington. The Middle East has undergone a dramatic realignment in recent years. The Saudis patched up a diplomatic spat with Qatar , Persian Gulf countries have begun setting aside longstanding differences with Turkey, and conflicts in Libya, Yemen and Syria have largely cooled down. The U.S. remains engaged in trying to broker a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia , but there are high hurdles. \"After the Saudi-Iran pact and now a prospective rapprochement between Syria and the kingdom, the U.S. is increasingly diplomatically sidelined,\" said Fabrice Balanche, a Middle East-focused assistant professor at the University of Lyon 2 in France. \"Middle East nations are making peace without Washington.\" For Mr. Assad, a deal with Saudi Arabia would be one of the final demonstrations that he prevailed in a grinding 11-year civil war, not just against the rebels but also against an array of foreign actors, including the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, who called for his removal from power. Mr. Assad used a devastating earthquake in his country\\'s north last month to make a push for normal diplomatic relations, visiting Oman and the United Arab Emirates in recent weeks. But he remains a pariah in most of the world, with overwhelming evidence that he used chemical weapons on Syrians and oversaw the killing of tens of thousands of civilians.

Now their investors may be a bit too hopeful that the U.S. government will do it for them. Stocks of the parent companies of TikTok\\'s main U.S. rivals jumped Thursday as Shou Zi Chew—chief executive officer of the red-hot social-media app—was grilled before Congress over a host of issues that are mostly related to the company\\'s Chinese ownership. Mr. Chew\\'s appearance before the House Energy and Commerce Committee came after the Biden administration threatened earlier this month to ban the app if the company\\'s Chinese owners didn\\'t divest their ownership stakes. The Chinese government responded Thursday, saying it would oppose any forced sale on the grounds that it would involve exporting technology that would require government approval. That appeared to increase the likelihood of an outright ban, which would come as good news to the social-media and online advertising giants that have ceded market share to TikTok over the past couple of years as the app has exploded in popularity, now reaching more than 150 million active users in the U.S. Thursday\\'s hearing was further evidence that a social app purportedly used by nearly half the U.S. population doesn\\'t have any friends in Washington. Committee members from both political parties roundly voiced concerns about TikTok\\'s Chinese ownership and expressed strong skepticism of the company\\'s stated plan to hive off data on U.S. users with the help of Oracle. \"Your platform should be banned,\" said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the committee\\'s Republican chair. \"I still believe that the Beijing communist government will still control and have the ability to influence what you do,\" said Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the panel\\'s top Democrat. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Snapchat parent Snap, Google parent Alphabet and Pinterest have seen their stocks average a 10% gain since March 15, when The Wall Street Journal reported the threat from the Biden administration. That is more than twice the Nasdaq Composite\\'s gains in that time. Together with Amazon, those companies generated more than $380 billion in online advertising revenue last year. But that was up only 6% from the previous year—a notable slump from the 28% annual growth averaged over the previous five years. So the prospect of having a formidable competitor being taken out of circulation is heartening, especially in a market that isn\\'t expected to turn back up anytime soon. Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik estimates that TikTok is on track to generate between $7 billion and $8 billion in revenue in the U.S. alone next year. He named Meta and Alphabet, which also owns TikTok competitor YouTube, as the companies most likely to benefit from a TikTok ban, but added that \"some ad dollars may just go back into ad buyer pockets or look for an experimental platform outside our cohort.\" Experienced D.C. watchers say it is still far from certain whether such a ban can even be enacted—and if it will stick. \"We remain below 50% that TikTok is ultimately banned in the U.S.,\" wrote Paul Gallant, policy analyst for TD Cowen, in a report Wednesday. Matt Perault of New Street Research notes that TikTok could challenge any ban on First Amendment grounds, which would result in a lengthy court battle at the very least. Mr. Chew may have gotten buried by political grandstanding on Thursday. But for investors, it is still too early to be dancing on TikTok\\'s grave. Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com', 'WASHINGTON—Top progressive Democrats said they have disagreements with President Biden but remain staunch supporters headed into the 2024 election, after moves by the administration on issues such as crime, immigration and energy policy angered the party\\'s left wing. Mr. Biden sided with Republicans on overturning Washington, D.C.\\'s crime code , prompting howls from progressives for stepping on home rule, and the White House has drawn scrutiny for considering a return to a policy of detaining migrant families who cross illegally into the U.S. The administration also approved the Willow oil-drilling project over the objections of environmentalists. Progressive lawmakers and activists criticized the moves, but the blowback has been limited. No major protests have emerged outside the White House, like those seen during former President Barack Obama\\'s administration , and there has been no talk of a serious primary challenger from the progressive flank. Many see Mr. Biden as critical to winning the coming presidential race and helping take back full control of Congress, even if they aren\\'t always on the same page. \"I\\'m opposed to the Willow project, which will mean fossil-fuel drilling on federal land, and I do think the president will need to have a bold climate policy to mobilize young voters in 2024,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), a progressive who is considering running for Senate next year. Still, on the presidential race, Mr. Khanna said: \"I\\'ll be backing him enthusiastically.\" Progressives have been the loudest voices within the party on matters including policing, LGBT issues, economic opportunity and protecting the environment. Mr. Biden ran in 2020 as a seasoned centrist but has worked with progressives on many of their priorities—including passing a bill designed to slow climate change and taking executive action to trim student loans. \"It\\'s no secret that the president wasn\\'t my first choice in 2020,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.) who leads the House progressives. But after working together she plans to support him in 2024. She said progressives will continue to \"push where we need to push.\" A recent NBC/PBS NewsHour poll said that 50% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents think Democrats have a better chance of winning the White House if Mr. Biden is the nominee, compared with 45% who think the party would do better with someone else. Mr. Biden is expected to formally announce he is running later this year. The White House said it is in regular touch with progressive leaders on Capitol Hill. With House Democrats now in the minority, progressives are pressuring Mr. Biden to take more executive actions, bypassing Congress. Staff for the Congressional Progressive Caucus met with the White House\\'s Office of Legislative Affairs on Tuesday to talk about their wish list , which includes a range of demands, from expanding worker overtime protections to declaring a national climate emergency. Last year, progressives pressed Mr. Biden to cancel student loan debt. Ultimately Mr. Biden issued an executive order to cancel up to $20,000 in debt , short of what some progressives wanted. The Supreme Court is expected to decide the fate of the program by late June. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) both ran against Mr. Biden in the 2020 Democratic primary, proposing student-loan forgiveness and expanded government health coverage. They now back Mr. Biden if he seeks another term. \"I think what the progressive movement in the country has done is to show the political establishment that millions of people are tired of status quo politics,\" said Mr. Sanders. \"Is he doing everything that I would like? No, but I think he has heard that message,\" he said. \"I thought they were wrong,\" Ms. Warren said of the president\\'s recent moves on immigration, drilling and crime, while praising his actions on climate and corporate taxes. \"Joe Biden and I don\\'t agree on everything, but I\\'m really glad he\\'s president of the U.S.,\" she said on NBC News. The White House cited Mr. Biden\\'s recently released budget , which proposes child care, paid leave and free community college, as showing shared goals. But the White House is also trying to take a tough line on issues such as crime and illegal immigration that Republicans make clear will be a focus in 2024. The Biden administration has crossed progressives on a string of issues in recent months. The administration approved the Willow oil-drilling project in the Alaskan Arctic, arguing it had limited legal options and stressed that the president has moved to block future oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Ocean\\'s federal waters. On immigration, the administration is considering a return to a policy of detaining migrant families as it looks to more restrictive policies to control the southern border. The White House said no decision has been made yet on family detention. On the D.C. crime bill, many Democrats were upset because they felt blindsided. The White House initially said it opposed the bill but then pivoted and said Mr. Biden would sign it. The White House said Mr. Biden never issued an explicit veto threat and emphasized his record of supporting funding for public safety. \"Our view is this is like a family,\" said White House Legislative Affairs Director Louisa Terrell of the D.C. bill. \"We have Democrats on the House side and Democrats on the Senate side, and we are a family, and we have heard this, and we\\'ve talked it through, and we\\'re now two weeks later, and we\\'re moving on,\" she said. Write to Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com and Natalie Andrews at natalie.andrews@wsj.com', 'TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has kept out of the limelight until recently. PHOTO: Alyssa Schukar for The Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON—TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Zi Chew has navigated both Western and Chinese business over the course of his fast rise to the corner office. That cultural straddle has helped land him the top job at one of the world\\'s biggest tech companies. His background also provided a potential connection with a skeptical American Congress . Many members have threatened to ban TikTok, saying its Chinese ownership poses a national-security threat . But on Thursday, the 40-year-old Singaporean army reservist and former Goldman Sachs banker faced a hostile House panel as he tried to reassure Americans their data is safe and Beijing won\\'t be able to influence what viewers see on TikTok. Hours before the testimony, Beijing said it would oppose a forced sale of the app from its Chinese owners, something the Biden administration has demanded . That amped up the hearing\\'s geopolitical dimensions, thrusting Mr. Chew into the middle of souring U.S.-China relations. House lawmakers then pummeled TikTok\\'s chief executive over the popular app\\'s ties to China. The congressional hearing was peppered with withering attacks on TikTok from both Democrats and Republicans, running more than five hours and underscoring growing concern about Beijing\\'s potential influence over the app. Born and raised in Singapore, then educated in London and at Harvard Business School, Mr. Chew spent some of his early career cutting deals for a venture-capital firm in Asia. He then quickly moved to the C-suite as the chief financial officer of a Chinese smartphone giant at age 32. He runs TikTok from offices in Singapore, but travels often, including frequently to the U.S. He met his wife, a Taiwanese-American who grew up in Bethesda, Md., at Harvard. Relatively unknown for the boss of one of the world\\'s most popular apps, Mr. Chew was sharply questioned by some of the company\\'s more skeptical critics on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Aides to the Republicans who control the committee say there is essentially nothing Mr. Chew can say that would change their minds as they threaten a nationwide ban. In an interview from the company\\'s WeWork offices in Washington, he said he views Thursday\\'s hearing as a chance to explain what TikTok is trying to do, and to get feedback from Congress members—not a last-gasp effort to save TikTok\\'s American business. \"I look at it as an opportunity to do that, not a do-or-die\" moment, he said. The corporate stakes for Mr. Chew are as high as they get for a CEO facing such an appearance in Washington. Some Congress members from both major parties are pushing for a nationwide ban of the video app, citing national-security threats. The Biden administration is demanding TikTok divest itself from its Chinese parent ByteDance Ltd. or face such a ban. Critics say China could force TikTok to hand over American user data or influence what American viewers see on the app. TikTok has said it has never received such a request and would refuse to comply with one. Mr. Chew took over the top job after Kevin Mayer, a high-profile Walt Disney Co. alum, left his post after three months, while the Trump administration pursued an earlier effort to force a sale of TikTok to U.S. investors. He is a native English speaker who, like most Singaporeans, is of Chinese ancestry. His father worked in construction and his mother in bookkeeping. He said he was uprooted from a modest upbringing at age 12, when high marks on a national exam sent him to an elite high school. Mr. Chew was put on an officer track during his mandatory 2½ years of military service. That added 10 years to his eligibility for reserve duty, which ends when he is 50. The hardest physical experience of his life, he said, was the military\\'s five-day survival course in Brunei\\'s jungles. He built a hut, cooked wild yams and trekked 55 miles. At one point during such courses, trainees are given a live quail that they can kill with their hands before skinning and cooking it. In the interview, Mr. Chew didn\\'t want to discuss what he did with his bird. After the military, Mr. Chew attended University College London and remained in the British capital to work as a banker for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Following an internship at Meta Platforms Inc.\\'s Facebook and business school, Mr. Chew worked for venture-capital firm DST Global. His high-school-level Mandarin qualified him to be its China-focused partner. In 2012, he visited the Chinese equivalent of a Silicon Valley garage: an apartment in Beijing\\'s university district. Thirty people, including a chef, crammed in to develop an app that suggested news articles to people based on factors such as how much time they spent on previous stories. The company was ByteDance Ltd ., which would later go on to create TikTok. Its founder, a young Zhang Yiming, won over Mr. Chew. He and his partners invested in the company. \"The idea is so simple but so powerful: that you should be looking at content not based on who you know, but really based on your own behavior,\" Mr. Chew said. Another investment Mr. Chew led was in Xiaomi Corp., a Chinese smartphone giant with global ambitions. Xiaomi brought him over first as chief financial officer, and then had him run its business outside China. One thing that stood out among colleagues was his grasp of both Chinese and Western business cultures. \"He\\'s perfectly bicultural,\" said Hugo Barra, a former Xiaomi executive who worked with Mr. Chew. \"That\\'s a critical asset for an executive of a Chinese company trying to become a global company.\" Mr. Chew led Xiaomi to an initial public offering in 2018, but its shares struggled immediately afterward, during a difficult financial period for Chinese tech companies. In 2021, Mr. Zhang, who had kept in touch with Mr. Chew, asked the Singaporean to become the finance chief of ByteDance, which in addition to TikTok operates other popular Chinese apps. Mr. Chew did that for two months until he and the founder decided he would be better off running TikTok. TikTok has rolled out billions of dollars of spending aimed at siloing off the app from its Chinese owners, and it said it would hire Oracle Corp. to independently monitor against any interference by Beijing. The measures amount to what the company says is an unprecedented effort to assure Americans their data is safe—one that keeps TikTok unprofitable for now. TikTok faces the ban from Washington while it continues to be hugely popular across the country. Mr. Chew, in his own TikTok video on Tuesday, appealed directly to American users, calling attention to the possible ban. In the video he said the app had 150 million users in the U.S., almost half the country\\'s population. Mr. Chew said he accepted the commerce committee\\'s invitation because he wanted to address misconceptions about TikTok, both to Congress and the American public. \"There are some things [being said] that are outright just wrong about our company, and we do need to clarify it,\" he said in the interview.

PHOTO: Kristen Norman for The Wall Street Journal General Mills Inc. executives said inflation isn\\'t letting up, but customers are sticking with its products despite higher prices in grocery stores. The Minneapolis-based maker of Cheerios and Betty Crocker cake mix said Thursday that it expects cost increases to moderate but remain above normal in the company\\'s fiscal 2024, which begins later this year. General Mills expects expenses tied to labor, energy and the company\\'s suppliers to keep cost inflation in the mid-single digits, compared with about 14% to 15% this fiscal year. \"The environment remains challenging and dynamic,\" said Jeff Harmening, General Mills\\' chief executive. General Mills executives said that while prices for some key raw commodities have declined from their recent peaks, costs incurred by suppliers that turn those commodities into products for the company are expected to remain elevated. Still, General Mills said consumers have taken higher prices in stride this year more than they have historically. General Mills on Thursday boosted its outlook for sales and profits after revenue rose 13% in its latest quarter, driven largely by higher prices. The amount of food the company sold globally was flat, including declines in its North American retail and international businesses. Mr. Harmening said consumers are still eating at home more than they did before the pandemic, and that General Mills sees that continuing. Consumers have seen their grocery bills surge as food makers have passed on what executives have said are climbing costs for ingredients, transportation and labor. Higher prices have helped boost sales for food manufacturers such as Kellogg Co. and Kraft Heinz Co., but they have often chipped away at volumes. Containing such rising costs is a central part of the Federal Reserve\\'s efforts to bring down inflation that remains stubbornly high. The consumer-price index, a closely watched inflation gauge, rose 6% in February from a year earlier, down from a 6.4% gain the prior month, according to the Labor Department. It was the smallest increase since September 2021. Food inflation has begun to slow , though U.S. grocery prices were still up 10% in February from a year earlier, the Labor Department said. An index for meats, poultry, fish and eggs fell 0.1% in February, the first decrease since December 2021. An index for eggs alone fell 6.7%. Sales at General Mills\\' North America retail division, which includes U.S. groceries, rose 15% in the quarter, which ended Feb. 26. The company said its products have gained market share in cereal, refrigerated dough, fruit snacks, soup and seasoning categories this year, as it has ratcheted up marketing spending. Rising costs hurt operating profit in the company\\'s pet food business, though sales in that unit also increased. \"The consumer seems to be reasonably robust,\" Mr. Harmening said. While private-label products, which are typically cheaper than brand-name equivalents, picked up market share during the last economic recession, Mr. Harmening said, General Mills was able to hang on to its share. General Mills\\' exposure to private-label products remains lower than average, which bodes well for its future, he said. General Mills shares closed 2.9% higher on Thursday. For the full year, General Mills now forecasts organic sales , which exclude acquisitions, divestitures and the impact of currency translation, rising between 10% and 11%, slightly higher than the outlook it gave last month. Per-share earnings are expected to rise 8% to 9% on an adjusted basis, also a slight increase. General Mills posted earnings of $553.1 million, or 92 cents a share, for the most recent quarter, down from $660.3 million, or $1.08 a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings were 97 cents a share, above analysts\\' estimates of 92 cents. Denny Jacob contributed to this article. Write to Jesse Newman at jesse.newman@wsj.com', 'When Yolett McPhee-McCuin saw the Mississippi women\\'s basketball coaching job was open in 2018, she didn\\'t wait for a call. She reached out to the school\\'s search firm and sold herself. \"I\\'m hot,\" she said. \"And y\\'all could get me for cheap.\" McPhee-McCuin had turned around Jacksonville University\\'s team from several losing seasons to 24-9. Ole Miss had little to lose, having won exactly one Southeastern Conference game the season before. Five years later, McPhee-McCuin and her No. 8-seeded Rebels engineered one of the NCAA women\\'s tournament\\'s biggest upsets, beating perennial power and No. 1 seed Stanford on Sunday. The Rebels face No. 5 Louisville on Friday in the Sweet 16. While women\\'s college basketball has been dominated by dynastic coaches or those who\\'ve played in the Olympics, McPhee-McCuin is \"out of the mud,\" she said. She grew up in the Caribbean nation of the Bahamas, whose entire national population of 408,000 wouldn\\'t quite fill the stands over an eight-game home season of Ole Miss football. McPhee-McCuin had an unremarkable college career—Miami-Dade Community College, followed by Rhode Island—then clambered up a splintery coaching ladder to become the reigning NCAA women\\'s tournament darling. McPhee-McCuin\\'s route included crisscrossing the U.S. to unglamorous assistant jobs: a junior college in the Texas panhandle city of Borger, nicknamed \"Booger Town\"; Arkansas-Pine Bluff; the University of Portland (Ore.); Pittsburgh; and Clemson before landing her first head coaching job, at Jacksonville. \"I always use, like, basketball analogies, and I say: For my life, y\\'all, I never get a wide-open layup,\" McPhee-McCuin said. \"I always have to do a pro-hop or a Euro step to score in life.\" Coach Yo, as she\\'s known, had a knack for connecting with people, though—precious currency in the player recruitment that drives college basketball. She told the Coach JB Show podcast this week: \"I don\\'t know that I\\'m ever going to be googly-eyes over the McDonald\\'s All-American. Give me the Wendy\\'s All-American all day, every day.\" It was a journey to an actual fast-food restaurant that helped land one of her most important recruits. Kayla Gordon, a standout at Meridian (Miss.) High in the early 2010s, recalled that she was a homebody with no interest in leaving the state. But Coach Yo wanted her on the team in Jacksonville, about an eight-hour drive away. So one day, McPhee-McCuin surprised Gordon by walking into the Chick-fil-A where she worked. As the two chatted, Gordon said she marveled at the steps McPhee-McCuin had taken: calling her mom to find out when she was working, making the trip, showing up and showing Gordon how much she valued her. \"I\\'m like, \\'Wow, I feel special,\\'\" Gordon recalled. Gordon played four years at Jacksonville, leading the team in rebounding her senior year. After school she took two more leaps inspired by Coach Yo: The former homebody went to Europe, playing professionally in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Finland. And Gordon went into coaching. She\\'s now an assistant women\\'s basketball coach at Jacksonville. Ross Bjork, the Ole Miss athletic director in 2018, said that Coach Yo was on Mississippi\\'s list of potential women\\'s basketball coaches—a list 25 people long. As he interviewed candidates, said Bjork, now Texas A&M\\'s athletic director, a representative of the search firm hired by the school reminded him, \"Hey, don\\'t forget about Coach Yo.\" That representative, now TurnkeyZRG managing director Chad Chatlos, said McPhee-McCuin was, \"just was like a bulldog: \\'Put me in front of the AD. I won\\'t let you down.\\' Yolett just had this perfect blend of being aggressive but being respectful of the process.\" Bjork and an Ole Miss colleague finally set up a FaceTime call with McPhee-McCuin and, Bjork said, \"She, like, jumped through the screen with her energy and passion.\" Coach Yo was also fearless, something he needed in a coach coming into a tough conference for a rebuilding job. McPhee-McCuin muddled through two rough seasons—9-22, 7-23—before pushing Ole Miss above .500 in 2021, then to the NCAA tournament\\'s first round in 2022. This season, the Rebels narrowly lost against SEC power LSU and defending NCAA champion South Carolina. Then came the second-round NCAA upset of Stanford and a spontaneous celebration by all the people who\\'ve been in Coach Yo\\'s orbit. The Bahamas Basketball Federation, for which McPhee-McCuin has coached the women\\'s national team and assisted in coaching the men\\'s team, congratulated her on its social-media sites. College football talk-show king Paul Finebaum had her on . Fellow Bahamian and WNBA star Jonquel Jones of the New York Liberty tweeted a video of herself dancing and saying, \"We just knocked out a No. 1 seed!\" Jones later explained in an interview: \"The Bahamas is a small country, so it\\'s \\'we.\\' We take our wins wherever we can get them.\" Jones—a four-time WNBA All-Star and the 2021 league MVP—said that McPhee-McCuin\\'s father, a legendary high school coach named Gladstone \"Moon\" McPhee, \"basically taught me everything I know about basketball.\" There were few games or tournaments for girls in the Bahamas, Jones said, so players had to fit into boys\\' schedules or train by themselves. As a teenager Yolett woke her father at 5 a.m. each weekday and they would head to an outdoor court to get a workout in. Then she would go home to clean up in time for her mother, Daisy, who was also the school principal, to unlock the school gates at 7 a.m., according to the Mississippi Clarion-Ledger . The Rebels took down Stanford the old-school way: with defense and free throws. Ole Miss forward Madison Scott recalled that Coach Yo had said the key to beating the Cardinal on their court—the women\\'s tournament awards higher-seeded teams with early-round home games—was improving on the Rebels\\' shooting from the line, a dismal 67.3% this season. \"Before we left, we were in Oxford (Miss.) shooting free throws every day before practice, after practice,\" Scott said. It paid off: Ole Miss made 11 of 14 free throws against Stanford. The Rebels won, 54-49. Jones said she was moved as she watched an on-court interview where Coach Yo called herself a \"little girl from the Bahamas that was given an opportunity\" and dedicated the win to \"people with a dollar and a dream.\" \"Of course, that\\'s going to resonate with so many other people, not just Bahamians, who have big dreams but they don\\'t necessarily know how they can get from point A to point B,\" Jones said. \"So for her to be able to share those stories is, you know, that\\'s what it\\'s all about. That\\'s what sports is all about.\" Write to Rachel Bachman at Rachel.Bachman@wsj.com', 'U.S.-China relations were dealt another blow as lawmakers at a House hearing pressed TikTok\\'s chief executive on the popular app\\'s ties to China, and as Beijing said it would fight any U.S. attempt to force the company\\'s sale by its Chinese owners. The hearing Thursday, peppered with withering attacks on TikTok from both Democrats and Republicans, ran more than five hours and underscored growing concern about Beijing\\'s potential influence over the app. U.S.-China relations are already frayed over trade, Taiwan, technology and geopolitical rivalries. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, seated in front of U.S. TikTok executives and popular stars on the platform, sought to reassure lawmakers that the company would earn their trust. \"Our approach has never been to dismiss or trivialize any of these concerns. We have addressed them with real action,\" he said. Rep. Frank Pallone (D., N.J.), the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, issued a blunt response to Mr. Chew\\'s claims. \"I don\\'t buy it,\" Mr. Pallone said. The committee\\'s chairwoman, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.), called for banning the app , which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. The bipartisan skepticism further clouded the future of a platform that TikTok says is now used by 150 million Americans . Hours before the hearing, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would \"firmly oppose\" the Biden administration\\'s recent demand that TikTok\\'s Chinese owners sell their stakes or face a possible ban. U.S. lawmakers pointed to that statement as evidence that the company was beholden to Beijing. TikTok\\'s travails have put it at the center of strained ties between the world\\'s two great economic powers as they quarrel over issues including trade policy, surveillance and technological development. Washington has stepped up sanctions against Chinese companies, and Beijing has deployed regulatory enforcement and other pressure tactics against American businesses. The resulting trade blacklists have swept up China-based telecommunications companies Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., as well as U.S. defense contractors Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Technologies Corp. \"The TikTok battles are indicative of the end of an era,\" said Lindsay Gorman, senior fellow for emerging technologies at the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, and a former Biden White House adviser. \"This era where U.S.-China business relations can continue absent considerations of geopolitics is over.\" The U.S. concerns over TikTok have partly stemmed from increased involvement in business activities by the Chinese government. Under leader Xi Jinping, China\\'s party-state has adopted laws and regulations to ensure its access to data collected by private firms, and expanded efforts to influence corporate governance and decision-making. China has also blocked U.S. social media and information sites including Alphabet Inc.\\'s Google and the Meta Platforms Inc.\\'s Facebook. A fund backed by China\\'s cybersecurity watchdog holds a 1% stake in the core subsidiary of TikTok\\'s Chinese parent, Bytedance Ltd., a what is called \"golden share\" that gives the regulator a board seat at the subsidiary, voting power and sway over its business decisions. Under questioning from Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R., Texas), Mr. Chew said that under the company\\'s security plan, TikTok\\'s data would be stored in the U.S. and controlled by a U.S. company, alleviating the concern. Mr. Crenshaw responded: \"I want to say this to all the teenagers out there and TikTok influencers who think we\\'re just old and out of touch and…. trying to take away your favorite app. You may not care that your data is being accessed now, but it will be one day when you do care about it.\" Mrs. Rodgers opened the questioning Thursday by asking Mr. Chew to state \"with 100% certainty\" that the Chinese government couldn\\'t use TikTok or ByteDance to surveil Americans or manipulate the content Americans see. Mr. Chew said the company was committed to firewalling U.S. user data from \"all unwanted foreign access\" and would keep content \"free from any manipulation from any government.\" \"If you can\\'t say it 100% certain, I take that as a \\'no,\\'\" Mrs. Rodgers shot back. \"I have zero confidence in your assertion that ByteDance and TikTok are not beholden to the [Chinese Communist Party].\" In his testimony , Mr. Chew said TikTok is spending $1.5 billion to create the firewall of U.S. data, leaving \"American data stored on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel.\" When that process is complete, he said, it should eliminate lawmakers\\' concern that some TikTok user data could be subject to Chinese law—though he said engineers globally could access it as required for business purposes. Asked about a possible sale, Mr. Chew said he didn\\'t think a change in ownership would improve safety and security, pointing to the privacy problems of U.S. tech platforms. Mr. Chew also said the platform would work to ensure a safe environment for young people, another concern of committee members. Rep. Bob Latta (R., Ohio) said TikTok had been insulated from legal claims arising from the death of a 10-year-old girl who had participated in a breath-holding challenge that was popular on TikTok. Mr. Latta questioned why TikTok should be protected by federal law shielding websites when it amplifies \"dangerous and life-threatening content to children.\" Mr. Chew said that the platform has taken a number of proactive steps to better protect children—including measures that go beyond those employed by other platforms. Accounts registered to teens under 16 are set to private by default, and they also can\\'t send direct messages. Their content is ineligible for recommendation in the app\\'s popular \"For You\" tab. He said dealing with harmful content was an industrywide challenge. Some lawmakers asked Mr. Chew if he agreed that China\\'s government has persecuted the Uyghur ethnic group, which U.S. officials have characterized as a genocide. Mr. Chew answered by saying content about that issue was available on TikTok. After the testimony ended, TikTok spokeswoman Brooke Oberwetter said that political grandstanding had dominated the hearing, ignoring the solutions TikTok was working on to protect user data and keep content harmful to young people off the site. The hearing shed little light on how Congress might address the numerous problems with TikTok that lawmakers highlighted. Several bills are under consideration in Congress that would ban TikTok outright, typically by prohibiting U.S. companies from doing business with it. Some would also allow the government to ban or restrict other apps with ties to hostile foreign governments. Several lawmakers also urged renewed consideration of comprehensive privacy legislation. An actual ban on TikTok faces practical and legal hurdles, and two federal judges struck down former President Donald Trump\\'s earlier attempts to do so. Any crackdown carries political risks, particularly for Democrats who tend to get more support from the younger people who are TikTok\\'s dominant audience. Democrats appeared less inclined than Republicans to support an outright ban on the app, at least for now. Three Democrats appeared Wednesday with a group of TikTok stars to protest calls to ban the app. But a number of lawmakers from both parties expressed interest in a sale of TikTok\\'s Chinese ownership. Rep. Lori Trahan (D., Mass.) said near the end of Thursday\\'s hearing that Mr. Chew had fallen short of gaining lawmakers\\' trust. \"To me, it hasn\\'t happened so far,\" she said. Rep. Randy Weber (R., Tex.) took a similar-sounding tone. \"If this committee has its way,\" he said, \"TikTok\\'s time is up.\" \\u200bLingling Wei, Stu Woo, Grace Zhu and Raffaele Huang contributed to this article.

McKinnon at John.McKinnon@wsj.com and Georgia Wells at georgia.wells@wsj.com', 'Virginia-based power company AES Corp. says it is ready to push the button on a solar-panel order of more than $1 billion if a manufacturer will commit to building a factory in the U.S. If that factory gets built, AES can buy its panels and apply for federal subsidies recently made available to clean-energy developers that use equipment made in the U.S. There is one problem: The government hasn\\'t decided what \"made in the U.S.\" means, and how strictly to define it. \"You can\\'t sign on the dotted line until this is clarified,\" said Andrés Gluski, AES\\'s chief executive. The company and two other developers have said they would collectively buy as much as $6 billion in panels from a manufacturer that sets up in the U.S. Just what qualifies as made in America is one of the biggest questions still hanging over the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed in August that offers hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits and other incentives for clean-energy projects . The issue is more complicated than it might seem, given that almost all clean-energy projects require at least some parts that are manufactured overseas. The law is supposed to spur not only the deployment of clean energy but also the creation of domestic jobs and industries to underpin that rollout. So lawmakers sprinkled support for U.S.-made products throughout the legislation—from rebates for buying electric vehicles that contain significant domestic content to bonus tax credits for solar or wind developers that use enough U.S.-manufactured equipment. \"If we\\'re going to use federal tax dollars, we\\'re going to direct that investment into the United States and create American jobs,\" said John Podesta, senior adviser to President Biden for clean-energy innovation and implementation, at a Houston energy conference in early March. \"We\\'ve for too long let our supply chains drift overseas, particularly to China.\" As much as half of potentially $500 billion-plus in investment generated by the Inflation Reduction Act\\'s incentives include some sort of domestic-content requirements or bonus, according to an analysis by research institute Rhodium Group. The money at stake has made defining what it would take to meet those requirements one of the most hotly contested aspects of the law, spurring complaints from governments as well as tussles among companies ranging from U.S. steelmaker Nucor Corp. to power company NextEra Energy Inc.—all of which are angling for as much of the green subsidies as possible. The details are being completed by the Treasury Department and are expected to come out over the next few months. The rules on one important incentive— a $7,500 tax rebate for electric-vehicle purchases , if the cars and their batteries meet domestic content and sourcing requirements—are expected by the end of this month. Meanwhile, many would-be investors are hanging back. In solar, wind and storage projects alone, about $20 billion in investment could be on hold while the government sorts out a variety of tax-credit details, with much of the attention on domestic-content rules, say clean-energy analysts. A big challenge is that much of the manufacturing the law is trying to spur barely exists in the U.S. today, from the silicon ingots and special glass needed for solar panels to the large steel plates for offshore wind arrays. The bulk of those products and components are instead imported from overseas, particularly China , which offers cheaper prices and controls the supply chain for goods such as solar panels and batteries. Defining \"made in America\" in a way that excludes most of those imports could mean nobody would meet domestic-content requirements or get the incentives tied to them, some green-energy developers say. Take solar projects, which under the legislation could in some cases receive 10% more in bonus tax credits if enough of the equipment by value is made domestically. That incentive has sparked a furious debate over solar panels, which alone can comprise 40% of the total equipment cost of a solar plant and are crucial to getting the bonus. Companies such as NextEra, the U.S.\\'s biggest developer of solar projects, are urging that panels assembled in the U.S. be considered American-made, even if the ingredients come from overseas. Such a definition would let more developers get bonus credits and encourage the construction of more solar farms, they reason. Developers need those bonus credits to offset higher panel costs that would come with moving more of the solar supply chain to the U.S., says AES clean-energy head Leonardo Moreno. Companies such as South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group\\'s Qcells unit, which is planning a U.S. factory for panel components such as solar cells, disagree. A solar panel shouldn\\'t be defined as U.S.-made if its most important pieces, especially the cells that convert sunlight to electricity, are made overseas, Hanwha said, in public comments submitted to the Treasury Department. Those components tend to be particularly costly and challenging to make, so the U.S. won\\'t be able to build a domestic solar supply chain unless renewable-power developers are nudged to buy panels that use them, said Michael Carr, a partner at government-affairs consulting firm Boundary Stone Partners, which is lobbying for some manufacturers. Another contentious point is how to treat equipment made of iron and steel, such as the tower that holds up the engine and blades of a wind turbine. The legislation says the iron and steel should be made in America for a renewable-energy project to qualify for domestic-content bonuses, but is vague on exactly what that means. BCI Steel makes tubes for solar-panel trackers in Leetsdale, Pa. U.S. steelmakers say equipment that uses imported steel shouldn\\'t count as being made in America. PHOTO: Ross Mantle for The Wall Street Journal Many renewable-energy developers are pushing for a domestic-content definition that would let them import many of those steel components. Such a definition would \"effectively nullify any benefit at all in the IRA,\" said Robert DeFrancesco, a lawyer at Wiley Rein LLP who is counsel for the Wind Tower Trade Coalition, a handful of big U.S. manufacturers. U.S. steelmakers have also weighed in, especially because the clean-energy industry\\'s demand for steel is expected to triple by 2030, according to some estimates. Developers \"shouldn\\'t get the credit that was intended to benefit American workers if they are bringing [steel] from overseas,\" said Al Behr, Nucor\\'s executive vice president for plate and structural steel. Write to Phred Dvorak at phred.dvorak@wsj.com', 'Hedge funds that bet on big-picture market moves have been hit with steep losses as a spate of recent bank failures upends bets that interest rates would remain elevated. The souring of the wager led some, including Maniyar Capital Advisors and Haidar Capital Management, to lose more than 20% this month. Many of the funds, which had notched big gains as rates marched steadily upward in 2022, are now flat to down for the year following a steep recent drop in Treasury yields. So-called trend-followers, which try to take advantage of momentum in markets, also were hurt. Some macro funds sustained lesser losses. Bridgewater Associates\\'s flagship Pure Alpha fund had lost a little more than 3% in March through Friday in its higher-volatility share class, while Switzerland-based EDL Capital, started by former Moore Capital Management money manager Edouard de Langlade, lost 5%, said people familiar with the firms. Overall, macro hedge funds lost an average 3.5% in the period, according to data from research firm HFR. Macro investors since late 2021 had widely been betting that stubbornly high inflation and a tight job market would cause the Federal Reserve to raise rates faster and for longer than previously expected. Instead, recent banking turmoil put a dent in rate expectations, with the yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note notching its largest weekly decline since 1987 last week. (Yields fall as bond prices rise.) Bonds also surged overseas. Traders say losses funds were taking on their bets against Treasurys spread to Japanese government bonds as managers unwound similar bets in efforts to curb losses. Many of the funds use leverage, or borrowed money, to amplify their bets, which can boost gains if the wagers pay off but prove costly if they sour. \"The magnitude of the losses really boils down to the fact that this was a levered trade that abruptly unwound,\" said Greg Dowling, chief investment officer of investment-consulting firm Fund Evaluation Group. In the span of some 48 hours in early March, Silicon Valley Bank\\'s collapse changed investors\\' expectations about the path of interest rates in the U.S., Mr. Dowling said. Where investors previously expected that the Federal Reserve would continue to raise rates, they suddenly were confronted with the possibility that the central bank would ease up, fearing a banking crisis could tip the U.S. economy into recession . Such regime shifts are usually accompanied by months of changing data and messaging from the Federal Reserve. The Fed on Wednesday approved a quarter-percentage-point rate increase but signaled it might be done hiking sooner than previously expected, causing Treasury yields to slip further. London-based Maniyar, a macro hedge fund partly owned by Paul Tudor Jones, lost 22% for the month through Friday, according to people familiar with the firm. Haidar\\'s Jupiter fund, which gained 193% in 2022, lost 32% for the period, said a person familiar with the firm. Bloomberg News earlier reported Haidar\\'s loss. Among trend followers, which also profited by betting on higher rates last year, the Tactical Trend fund of the $18 billion Graham Capital Management lost about 10% for the month through Friday, said people familiar with the firm. Stockholm-based Lynx Asset Management\\'s diversified trend-following strategy, the Lynx Program, also lost roughly 10% for the period. Rob Christian, investment chief at K2 Advisors, a Franklin Templeton unit that invests more than $10 billion of client money in hedge funds, said some giveback of outsize gains was to be expected for trend followers, officially known as commodity trading advisers, or CTAs. \"I always tell people you have to have an iron stomach to invest in CTAs,\" he said. A rare fund that profited is $1 billion Key Square Capital Management, based in Greenwich, Conn. In a March 13 investor letter, founder Scott Bessent, a former investment chief for George Soros, wrote that Key Square the prior week had increased its funds\\' exposures to gold and safe-haven currencies, shorted bank stocks and pulled back on energy exposure. Mr. Bessent since late last year had warned his clients that banks could face losses in their fixed-income and structured-products portfolios. SVB\\'s failed attempt to sell shares before it collapsed the week of March 6 was a signal to Mr. Bessent that Fed rate increases were causing stress in the financial sector, he wrote. It was one of several \"signposts\" that prompted him to further position Key Square\\'s portfolio for deepening turmoil. A person familiar with the firm said Key Square\\'s main hedge fund was up 2.5% for the month through Friday. Another fund employing more leverage had gained 5%.

Executives in the industry are betting it is worth drilling again in some of the hardest places to do business in the world as Europe increasingly turns to other sources for its energy needs after shunning its main supplier, Russia, over the invasion of Ukraine . In recent months, a string of European officials have visited the region to help advance talks over potential supply deals. Halliburton and Honeywell International Inc. are hammering out $1.4 billion worth of deals to develop an oil field and refinery with National Oil Corporation in Libya, which has the largest known oil reserves in Africa, according to the chairman of state-owned firm, Farhat Bengdara. Italy\\'s Eni is planning investments aimed at replacing nearly half of the gas it was importing from Russia with gas from Algeria. Chevron is also looking to seal an energy exploration deal in Algeria, The Wall Street Journal reported last month . In January, the U.S. oil major announced a sizable natural-gas discovery in Egypt. \"North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,\" said Geoff Porter, president of U.S.-based North Africa Risk Consulting Inc. But with Europe needing to replace Russian energy , \"this is their moment,\" he said. Western oil executives say they see a more stable political climate in North Africa, especially in countries such as Libya where fighting between local militias has been subdued in the past two years following nearly a decade of civil war. Many American firms had pulled back from the region, viewing it as politically too risky, to focus on shale production at home. The region\\'s proximity to Europe and massive reserves, with Algeria holding the third-largest recoverable shale resources in the world, also make doing business there worth the risk, they say. At the same time, state-owned firms in the North African region have been eager to strike deals, as they see an opportunity to fill a gap left by Russia and take advantage of higher global commodity prices. Some countries, such as Egypt, are eager to bring in additional revenue from selling energy, as their economies struggle with higher import costs including for food . The Ukraine war has disrupted shipments and pushed up global commodity prices. \"I think we can be a good replacement for Russian gas to Europe,\" NOC\\'s Mr. Bengdara said. The Libyan state-owned company is expected to soon sign a $1 billion agreement with Halliburton that will allow the U.S. firm to rebuild the al-Dhara oil field, according to Mr. Bengdara. The oil field in central Libya was destroyed by Islamic State militants in 2015 and is now run by ConocoPhillips and TotalEnergies SE, Mr. Bengdara said. It would be one of the biggest deals for the U.S. oil-services giant clinched in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years. Halliburton and Total didn\\'t respond to requests for comment. ConocoPhillips declined to comment. Libya\\'s NOC and Honeywell are set to unveil a contract related to the construction of a refinery in southern Libya, Mr. Bengdara and a spokesman for the American firm said. The initial deal, expected to be announced this weekend, is for the design of the plant, the spokesman said, which would be followed by a $400 million pact to build the entire plant. Libya relies heavily on its oil resources for income, although it has struggled for years to turn its own crude into motor fuel, making it largely dependent on costly gasoline imports. As of last year, the North African nation was divided politically again, with a United Nations-appointed prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, remaining in control of the capital Tripoli and a rival prime minister taking charge of the country\\'s east. The country is again pushing to hold presidential and legislative elections this year, after plans fell through in 2021. Still, there have been no serious clashes since last summer and its eastern government in recent months has unlocked some of the budget needed by the state oil company to clinch deals with international companies. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a senate committee on Wednesday that the U.S. was actively working to reopen an embassy in Libya, in part so it could better support the prospect of Libyan elections. The U.S. shut its embassy in Tripoli in 2014 following violent clashes between militias. The U.S. also pressured a top Libyan commander in mid-January to expel Russia\\'s paramiliatry Wagner Group , the Journal reported last month, amid fears the unit may tap into the country\\'s oil riches. Khalifa Haftar, commander of a faction that controls eastern Libya , is aligned with the government in Tripoli . \"There is recognition in the U.S. that Libya is a workable environment,\" said Mr. Porter, who advises U.S. oil companies in the region. He added that firms now see it as \"an environment in which you can operate reasonably safely, where you can more predictably invest in ways that you could not have a few years ago.\" NOC exports most of its gas to Europe through a pipeline from Libya to Italy. Over the next three to five years, it aims to increase oil production to 2 million barrels a day, from around 1.2 million currently, and to produce 4 billion standard cubic feet of gas a day, up from roughly 2.6 billion. In January, NOC and Eni, which produces the majority of the country\\'s gas, signed an $8 billion deal for the Italian energy giant to develop two gas fields to pump 850 million cubic feet a day for 25 years. Under the agreement, production of gas will start in 2025, ramping up to full capacity of 850 million cubic feet a day by 2026. In Algeria, Eni is aiming to export an additional 3 billion cubic meters of gas annually, starting this year, to help make up for gas that used to flow from Russia. Algeria will become the firm\\'s top region for investment in the next four years. \"Algeria is a reliable partner of absolute strategic importance,\" said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during a visit to Algiers in January. From Egypt, Eni aims to export three billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Italy starting this year, after regas capacity was built up on the receiving end. That compares with roughly 1 billion cubic meters being exported last year. Egypt\\'s ability to export gas is limited given the growing electricity demand of its more than 100 million population. It doesn\\'t have any pipelines to Europe. Still, the country has ambitions to become a hub for energy distribution in the Mediterranean, importing more gas from Israel and exporting liquefied gas on ships to Italy.

Write to Chao Deng at chao.deng@wsj.com and Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com', 'GARDEN CITY, Kan. -- Southwest Kansas officials have long pushed a moonshot aqueduct project to send Missouri River water across the state to their region, where a $12.5 billion agricultural economy relies on a dwindling underground aquifer. While the effort has been dismissed as legally impossible and expensive, the persistence of the idea demonstrates how drought and a steadily shrinking water supply have created broad consensus that water policies need to be overhauled. In Kansas, where federal data shows that nearly every county was experiencing some level of drought at the end of 2022, water is among the most urgent issues facing the state legislature this year. \"Water has a certain value,\" said Clay Scott, a Ulysses, Kan., farmer and one of the aqueduct\\'s proponents. \"Every year it just continues to climb.\" Projects that move water have been used to fuel development or to irrigate crops in Western states such as Arizona and California. The Kansas aqueduct would be farther east -- reflecting spreading concern about the scarcity of water amid a changing climate and growing population centers. Similar projects are being discussed elsewhere. A groundwater-conservation district in Texas is interested in studying water-transportation projects, including a version of the Kansas aqueduct route extended to Texas, said district manager Steve Walthour. Some arid states have looked east to boost limited water supplies. The Arizona state legislature in 2021 asked Congress to study a plan to transport Mississippi River floodwaters to the Colorado River, upon which seven states including Arizona rely. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers first assessed the feasibility for a Kansas aqueduct in 1982, as part of a federal study looking at ways to supplement the Ogallala Aquifer, the region\\'s critical source of groundwater. A 2015 update of the study estimated it would cost between $5 billion and $20 billion to build the concrete-lined canal system and up to $522 million in annual energy costs to pump the water uphill to its terminal reservoir in western Kansas. Proponents of the Kansas aqueduct say it is needed to sustain the economy of the state\\'s southwest and could sell water to other Western areas that have already taken extreme measures to conserve water or find new water sources. Without a means to augment the region\\'s underground reserves, \"we will continue to dry up the infrastructure for feed yards and dairies and grain elevators and cotton gins,\" said Mr. Scott, who is a member ofthe board for the Southwest Kansas Groundwater Management District. Opponents say the idea is too expensive, and would need to fend off a likely onslaught of lawsuits from states along the Missouri River or landowners whose property would be used to build a canal system. \"The legal, economic, physical and regulatory hurdles this thing faces are virtually infinite,\" said Burke Griggs, a law professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., who is an expert in water law and who previously represented Kansas in federal and interstate water issues. \"There\\'s no way this will ever be built.\" Even those who have taken no position on an aqueduct say much of the aquifer could run dry before the project is complete. \"By the time you got done with studying, planning, litigating, constructing,\" said Connie Owen, who heads the Kansas Water Office, an agency that writes the state\\'s water plan, \"it is too late.\" The Ogallala Aquifer lies under parts of eight central U.S. states, running from South Dakota to Texas. It adds $3.8 billion to the value of the land in western Kansas, one 2022 study found. Blake Brownie Wilson, with the Kansas Geological Survey, says 80% to 90% of the aquifer\\'s water in Kansas goes to irrigation. In some parts of southwest Kansas, the aquifer has dropped more than 100 feet since it began being mined. About 30% of it had been pumped as of 2013. An additional 39% was expected to be gone by 2063 given current rates of use. In December, aboard in the Kansas Water Office recommended that the state stop its policy of slowly draining the aquifer. \"Planned depletion was the operative approach,\" Ms. Owen said. \"It still is.\" Recent drought has increased pressure on the aquifer\\'s use. Groundwater levels fell nearly 3 feet in southwest Kansas, which is experiencing the most intense and widespread drought nationwide. Less than an inch of rainfall typically seeps into the aquifer to recharge it each year. The groundwater district that manages water use in southwest Kansas thinks conserving water is appropriate but not enough. Officials in the district have been the primary proponents of the aqueduct plan in Kansas. The project remains a long shot. Kansas lawmakers this year are focused on bills aimed at promoting conservation and dedicating tax revenue to water projects. Proponents say it is the right time to look into an aqueduct because of how long it would take to be built. \"We can\\'t afford to wait any longer,\" said Mr. Scott.', 'WASHINGTON -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 Republican presidential candidate, sought to qualify his controversial remark that Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine was a \"territorial dispute.\" \"Well, I think it\\'s been mischaracterized,\" he told broadcaster Piers Morgan for an interview to be shown Thursday on the streaming service Fox Nation. Mr. Morgan included the comments in a column Wednesday for The New York Post. \"Obviously, Russia invaded. That was wrong,\" Mr. DeSantis said, according to the column. \"They invaded Crimea and took that in 2014. That was wrong.\" He added, \"What I\\'m referring to is where the fighting is going on now which is that eastern border region Donbas, and then Crimea, and you have a situation where Russia has had that. I don\\'t think legitimately but they had . . . . so it wasn\\'t that I thought Russia had a right to that.\" Mr. DeSantis said last week that the U.S. shouldn\\'t necessarily help defend Ukraine against Russia\\'s invasion and should instead focus resources on issues closer to home. It aligned him with the position of former President Donald Trump and some conservatives who have increasingly questioned thetens of billions the U.S. has provided in security assistance to Ukraine. \"While the U.S. has many vital national interests -- securing our borders, addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy security and independence, and checking the economic, cultural, and military power of the Chinese Communist Party -- becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them,\" Mr. DeSantis had said in a statement broadcast on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" on Fox News.', 'Kassie Meiler endured six hours in an online waiting room to score tickets to one of Taylor Swift\\'s coming concerts. Now, she is gearing up -- literally -- for the stamina test of the pop star\\'s 44-song, three-hour show. Instead of heels, the 27-year-old plans to wear platform Keds, the sneaker brand Ms. Swift once endorsed. Rather than a sparkly fringe jacket similar to what Ms. Swift sports onstage, Ms. Meiler is seeking a cooler option for the April show in Tampa, Fla., that she will attend, perhaps in vest form. She will swap her usual cocktail or white wine for an electrolyte drink, she said. Mentally, Ms. Meiler is pulling confidence from the 24-hour dance marathons she completed in college: \"If I can do that, I can do a Taylor Swift tour.\" Ms. Swift stunned fans opening night on her first tour in five years by performing a 190-minute set that followed two opening acts. Word spread quickly online of the stadium show\\'s length, prompting nervous strategy brainstorms among fans now rethinking everything from their elaborate outfits to hydration methods. The Eras Tour, which is scheduled to run 52 stadium dates, is forecast to become the highest-grossing tour of all time, according to concert-data tracker Pollstar. The show is a combination of Ms. Swift\\'s pandemic pursuits and her efforts to take ownership of her life\\'s work by rerecording her early music. After her festival-style shows for her 2019 \"Lover\" album were canceled because of Covid-19, she released two surprise albums penned in pandemic isolation. The Eras Tour set list spans her entire catalog, including songs from \"Folklore,\" which won the Grammy for Album of the Year and \"Evermore,\" which earned a Grammy nomination -- as well as hits that she rerecorded from \"Fearless\" and \"Red.\" Late last year, she released \"Midnights,\" which shattered sales records. Packing so much material into one show amounts to an endurance test for Ms. Swift, too. Her 44-song set dwarfs that of other rock stars known for long shows, according to data from Setlist.fm. Prince\\'s 2004 shows and Beyonce\\'s 2018 Coachella sets each averaged 32 songs. Bruce Springsteen averaged 29 songs in 1985 and 27 in 2012. Bob Dylan\\'s 1978 world tour averaged 28 songs, according to Setlist.fm. Stadium shows are a badge of honor for music\\'s biggest stars. Only an elite few can fill them, and on this tour Ms. Swift has sold out multiple nights in each city she visits. Her Homeric effort, which includes the 10-minute version of fan-favorite song \"All Too Well,\" is baffling fans and industry insiders. \"Sure, Springsteen and Prince played these legendary long shows, but they were not singing the entire time. They had bands, and a whole lot of instrumental work that extended out the show,\" said Nathan Hubbard, former Ticketmaster chief executive and co-host of the Ringer\\'s \"Every Single Album: Taylor Swift\" podcast series. \"Taylor is singing as the center lead for the entirety of the show, and she\\'s doing it in heels,\" he said. A representative for Ms. Swift didn\\'t respond to a request for comment. In addition to singing and dancing, Ms. Swift flies, runs, climbs and, yes, even dives around the stadium -- in a series of custom Christian Louboutins. \"Three-hour shows. @taylorswift is definitely a distance swimmer,\" Olympic gold-medalist swimmer Katie Ledecky tweeted Tuesday. Mr. Hubbard estimated that if Ms. Swift\\'s movements were tracked as soccer players were during the World Cup, she travels a mile during the show, maybe two. Former NFL defensive end J.J. Watt lauded Ms. Swift\\'s rigor in a 2 1/2-minute video posted to Twitter after seeing her Saturday show in Glendale, Ariz. \"She did not stop the whole time -- there was no halftime, there was no TV timeouts,\" he said. \"She crushed it, and she didn\\'t even look tired. I was tired, and I was just sitting there.\" Daniela Morgan, 40, is doubling up on Las Vegas shows this weekend. On Friday night, she is attending solo with a $760 standing-room-only floor ticket. For Saturday night, She initially planned to take a friend, but her 10-year-old son, Eli, begged to go instead. Eli has heard reminders from his dad about the responsibility that comes with taking a $350 ticket to see his mom\\'s favorite artist, Ms. Morgan said. \"Is my kid going to be able to hang three hours?\" she said. Claire Ginther, a 26-year-old from Huntington Beach, Calif., has a shoe dilemma. To see Ms. Swift in Las Vegas this weekend, she had planned an outfit based on the pastel, 1960s aesthetic of Ms. Swift\\'s \"Lover\" album. Her new go-go boots arrived this week, but now she is debating switching to sneakers for comfort. With her 5\\'1\" height and $750 floor tickets, she risks not being able to see much, she said. For advice, she is combing through TikTok, where concertgoers are trading survival tips. \"You\\'d think people are talking about running the L.A. Marathon,\" she said. \"They\\'re talking about going to see Taylor Swift.\" Meanwhile, Ms. Ginther wonders about Ms. Swift\\'s stamina lasting until the tour\\'s closing shows in Los Angeles in August, for which Ms. Ginther said she paid $100 for a nosebleed seat. \"Is she just going to be crawling to the finish line when she gets to L.A.?\" For an April show in Texas, Catherine Frisina, 33, plans to hydrate sparingly with Liquid I.V., a powder that is mixed with water and promises an energy boost. \"If Taylor doesn\\'t need a bathroom break neither do I,\" she said. Andrea Alfano, who fueled up with pizza for back-to-back concerts on the tour\\'s opening weekend, said making it through the actual show isn\\'t the hardest part. \"The adrenaline of being there carries you through the show itself,\" the 26-year-old daycare teacher said. It was after the show in Glendale -- facing an hourslong wait for an Uber -- when she realized she was tired and her cowboy-boot-clad feet hurt. \"The hardest part is getting out of the stadium.\" At three hours, Rob Dobyns said his favorite part about Ms. Swift\\'s coming show in Kansas City is that his wife and three teen daughters are going and he isn\\'t. The 45-year-old prefers \\'90s Seattle grunge bands but calls himself a Taylor Swift fan by proxy. \"I couldn\\'t tell you the name of any songs but as they\\'re constantly screamed throughout the house, I could probably sing along to several.\" His wife, whom he calls \"the hype man for our family,\" will make the three-hour trek from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Kansas City, Mo., where the four of them will stay in a hote. Back home, Mr. Dobyns, a retired cop turned software engineer, has plans for a marathon of his own: scary movies, beer and steaks for himself and the dog.', 'TORONTO -- Multinational companies are pumping billions of dollars into Canada\\'s electric-vehicle manufacturing sector, lured by government incentives, access to raw materials and cheap renewable energy. In the latest sign of interest in the country, German auto maker Volkswagen Group last week said it had chosen a site in the province of Ontario to build its first battery-cell plant outside Europe. A company spokesman declined to provide specifics about the investment, but Canada\\'s industry minister said the investment, in the town of St. Thomas, 120 miles northeast of Detroit, could rank as the largest ever made in Canada\\'s auto sector. \"This is a big moment for Canada,\" said Francois-Philippe Champagne, Canada\\'s minister of innovation, science and industry, about the many investments. Volkswagen cited Canada\\'s natural resources as one of the reasons for choosing Ontario. \"Canada offers ideal conditions, including the local supply of raw materials and wide access to clean electricity,\" the company said. Volkswagen\\'s planned factory follows recent electric-vehicle and battery-making project investments by General Motors Co., Stellantis NV, French tire maker Michelin NV, Brazilian miner Vale, its U.K.-based rival Rio Tinto PLC, and German chemicals company BASF SE, among others. Canada is benefiting from a push by the U.S. and its allies to reduce their dependence on China for the critical minerals used in electric-vehicle batteries and military equipment. Companies announced more than $11 billion in investments in electric-vehicle-related projects in Canada last year, according to a tally of company announcements. The U.S., which has an economy that is 12 times as large as Canada\\'s, recorded $38.9 billion of similar investments in 2022, according to the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan-based nonprofit. In one example, Stellantis and South Korea\\'s LG Energy Solution are building a $4.1 billion battery plant in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river from Detroit. The joint venture, named NextStar Energy Inc., broke ground on the factory late last year and could employ 2,500 workers when it becomes operational in 2024, Stellantis said. Canada has had to pay up to win the investments, scrambling to keep up with the U.S., which has unveiled a raft of subsidies and tax breaks meant to draw capital investment in the EV industry. In the case of the NextStar project, Canada\\'s federal government and the province of Ontario gave more than one billion Canadian dollars, equivalent to $732 million, to the joint venture, said people with knowledge of the transaction. The Canadian government has also contributed money to investments by Rio Tinto, Honda Canada Inc., GM and others. The new investments, many of which are still in the early stages, come amid a decadeslong decline in the Canadian auto industry. Canada is among the most expensive countries in the world to build cars and the highest-cost market for car assembly in the North American free-trade zone. To save money, auto makers in recent decades moved thousands of manufacturing jobs and motor-vehicle assembly capacity to Mexico. At its peak in 1999, Canadian auto production surpassed three million vehicles and employed more than 175,000 people, according to the Trillium Network for Advanced Manufacturing, a nonprofit. Last year, the local industry produced 1.2 million vehicles and employed 110,000 people. It is unclear whether the new investments will reverse the declining trend, said Greig Mordue, an associate processor at the University of McMaster\\'s W. Booth School of Engineering Practice and Technology. Making batteries and electric vehicles needs fewer people than assembling internal-combustion-engine cars, he said, and the amount of money invested using taxpayer funds could limit the economic benefit. \"Until we know how much we paid for this, I\\'ll reserve my judgment on how good a deal this is,\" said Mr. Mordue, in reference to the Volkswagen deal. Mr. Champagne declined to disclose the value of subsidies and incentives that the government offered Volkswagen. He said the long-term benefits to the Canadian economy from the new projects justify the government\\'s investments.', 'WASHINGTON -- TikTok launched a battalion of influencers in the nation\\'s capital Wednesday to send a message to Congress: Banning the app would be met with widespread popular opposition. \"TikTok is not a children\\'s dancing app,\" said Aidan Kohn-Murphy, a college freshman with close to 300,000 TikTok followers and founder of the advocacy group Gen-Z for Change. \"It is one of the most powerful tools that young people have to engage each other and to get civically involved.\" Mr. Kohn-Murphy was one of more than 20 TikTok personalities with wide followings who traveled to the capital this week at the company\\'s invitation to lobby lawmakers and others in advance of TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew\\'s appearance before a House committee on Thursday. The influencers\\' blitz is part of TikTok\\'s response to persistent concerns among U.S. officials that the app, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., could be used by the Chinese government to spy on Americans or promote divisive or manipulative content. The Biden administration recently demanded that TikTok\\'s Chinese owners sell their stakes in the company or face a possible U.S. ban of the app, and members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee are expected to question Mr. Chew about the security concerns and other issues. TikTok maintains that it isn\\'t beholden to any government and is a vital platform for 150 million American users -- a theme the influencers worked to underscore in a meeting with journalists near the Capitol on Wednesday. \"It would be difficult to be able to support a candidate that would take away something that is so integral to the direction we\\'re going as a society,\" said Baedri Nichole, a bakery owner from Columbus, Ohio, whose \"hot cocoa bomb\" confection is a hit on TikTok. Kenny Jary, an 81-year-old retiree known on TikTok as Patriotic Kenny, said he uses the app to raise money to buy mobility scooters for fellow veterans. Others said the app provided a platform to launch small businesses or discuss topics such as eldercare and mental health. TikTok covered the group\\'s travel and accommodation expenses. The company bused the influencers on Wednesday to the Capitol grounds, where they gathered on a scenic rooftop to shoot their own videos and stand for journalists\\' interviews. After threats of banning the app started during the Trump administration, the company has spent recent years building a U.S.-based security apparatus to wall off U.S. user data and give officials the ability to inspect the computer code that recommends a steady feed of videos to users. TikTok stars were a crucial factor in the company\\'s successful effort to fight off a proposed ban during the Trump years. Whether they will have the same influence this time around remains to be seen. \"I\\'m aware of the popularity of the platform. I\\'m not oblivious,\" said Rep. Yvette Clarke (D., N.Y.), a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee who hasn\\'t yet taken a position on a potential ban. \"However, it\\'s important to weigh our equities here. National security has to be addressed.\" Ahead of Mr. Chew\\'s appearance, TikTok has ramped up lobbying efforts with the help of Oracle Corp., its U.S. data-security partner. Advertisements at the capital\\'s Metro subway stops tout the company\\'s commitment to user safety.', 'The most memorable event of the 2023 baseball season took place on Tuesday night, over a week before the MLB regular season is set to begin. With a full count and two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning of a one-run game, Los Angeles Angels superstar Shohei Ohtani stood on the mound in Miami and faced his Angels teammate, Mike Trout. It was the U.S. against Japan in the title game of the World Baseball Classic. But it was also the marquee moment baseball fans have been hoping to see since Ohtani made his MLB debut in 2018: The two greatest baseball players in the world, performing in a high-leverage moment in a championship game. The twist was that they were opponents, not teammates. \"The baseball world won tonight,\" said Team USA manager Mark DeRosa after Japan\\'s 3-2 victory in the final. Ohtani didn\\'t spare Trout in his effort to close out the victory for Japan. He set up the at-bat with a sweeping slider, then fired off four consecutive fastballs to Trout, all around 100 miles per hour or faster. Ohtani struck Trout out swinging on another sweeping slider, ending the game, the tournament, and setting up quite a scenario in the Angels clubhouse when the two report back to spring training this week. \"This was probably the funnest 10 days I\\'ve ever had,\" Trout said after the game. As a member of the Angels, he has only appeared briefly in the MLB playoffs once. Ohtani hasn\\'t appeared in the playoffs at all. Ohtani won the battle against Trout, but the two typically stolid superstars spent the tournament showing big emotions as they each worked their way toward that final at-bat. Trout was the first to reach base against Japan, legging out a first-inning double and giving an emphatic salute as he found himself safe. Ohtani was the engine of Team Japan, delivering a pregame speech to his teammates in the clubhouse before the final game of the tournament. The two players have to this point spent their MLB careers mostly languishing in Anaheim, with the chance to compete for a championship maddeningly out of reach. In this matchup, Trout and Ohtani weren\\'t just given the opportunities to experience baseball on a big stage. They were clear leaders for their respective teams. The chance to see the longtime teammates face off against one another represented the best that international baseball has to offer. \"This is the greatest game in the world,\" Angels manager Phil Nevin said after watching his star players from Arizona. \"No other sport can bring drama like baseball.\" Earlier in the tournament, it was expected that Ohtani would pitch in a quarterfinals game then return to spring training to make an exhibition start to line him up for opening day. When Japan reached the WBC final, the Angels authorized him to depart from his typical routine to be available to pitch against the U.S. Now, he closed out the tournament and won its MVP, and is still on track to take the ball on Angels opening day. This year\\'s WBC turned out to be a massive success for MLB -- even accounting for major injuries to Mets closer Edwin Diaz (out for the season with a knee injury) and Astros second baseman Jose Altuve (broken thumb after being hit by a pitch). They were reminders of the risk of playing full-effort games in March. The tournament turned out to have high-energy, competitive games, and the final matchup of USA-Japan was undoubtedly a pairing of baseball powerhouses. The WBC will return in 2026, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred told reporters in Miami on Tuesday. \"The World Series is always gonna be the World Series,\" Manfred said. \"This is a different kind of competition. We do it to grow the game and internationalize the game.\" Ohtani was named the tournament\\'s MVP after hitting .435, with a .606 on base percentage and a .739 slugging percentage in seven games for Japan. He also had a 1.86 ERA in three appearances -- two starts and his appearance as the closer in the final. The tournament furthered his status as an international spectacle, and he wept on the field as he lined up with the rest of Team Japan to be honored during the trophy ceremony. Ohtani and Trout, along with Team Mexico pitcher Patrick Sandoval, will return to the Angels clubhouse with plenty of material for trash talking and an early-season taste of championship excitement. Whether the experience will benefit the Angels remains to be seen. They still face tough competition this season, particularly against the defending champion Astros in the American League West. MLB\\'s regular season begins a week from Thursday, and players who faced one another in the WBC will be reunited as teammates for the long season marathon. For years, baseball wanted to see Ohtani and Trout playing on a big stage. They got there as opponents, but the next step for their careers will be getting there as teammates.', 'WASHINGTON -- TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Zi Chew has navigated both Western and Chinese business over the course of his fast rise to the corner office. That cultural straddle has helped land him the top job at one of the world\\'s biggest tech companies. His background may now help him connect with a skeptical American Congress. Many members have threatened to ban TikTok, saying its Chinese ownership poses a national-security threat. On Thursday, the 40-year-old Singaporean Army reservist and former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker is slated to appear before a House panel to argue against a ban and reassure Americans their data are safe and Beijing won\\'t be able to influence what viewers see on TikTok. Born and raised in Singapore, then educated in London and at Harvard Business School, Mr. Chew spent some of his early career cutting deals for a venture-capital firm in Asia. He then quickly moved to the C-suite as the chief financial officer of a Chinese smartphone giant at age 32. He runs TikTok from offices in Singapore but travels often, including frequently to the U.S. He met his wife, a Taiwanese-American who grew up in Bethesda, Md., at Harvard. Relatively unknown for the boss of one of the world\\'s mostpopular apps, Mr. Chew will be asked to defend the company in front of some of its more skeptical critics on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Aides to the Republicans who control the committee say there is essentially nothing Mr. Chew can saythat would change their mindsas they threaten a nationwideban. In an interview from the company\\'s WeWork offices in Washington, he said he views Thursday\\'s hearing as a chance to explain what TikTok is trying to do and to get feedback from Congress members -- not a last-gasp effort to save TikTok\\'sAmerican business. \"I look at it as an opportunity to do that, not a do-or-die\" moment, he said. The corporate stakes for Mr. Chew are as high as they get for a CEO facing such an appearance in Washington. Some Congress members from both major parties are pushing for a nationwide ban of the video app, citing national-security threats. The Biden administration isdemanding TikTok divestitself from its Chinese parent, ByteDance Ltd., or face such a ban. Critics say China could force TikTok to hand over American user data or influence what American viewers see on the app. TikTok has said it has never received such a request and would refuse to comply with one. Mr. Chew took over the top job afterKevin Mayer,a high-profile Walt Disney Co. alum, left his post after three months, while the Trump administration pursued an earlier effort to force a sale of TikTok to U.S. investors. He is a native English speaker who, like most Singaporeans, is of Chinese ancestry. His father worked in construction and his mother in bookkeeping. He said he was uprooted from a modest upbringing at age 12, when high marks on a national exam sent him to an elite high school. Mr. Chew was put on an officer track during his mandatory 2 1/2 years of military service. That added 10 years to his eligibility for reserve duty, which ends when he is 50. The hardest physical experience of his life, he said, was the military\\'s five-day survival course in Brunei\\'s jungles. He built a hut, cooked wild yams and trekked 55 miles. At one point during such courses, trainees are given a live quail that they can kill with their hands before skinning and cooking it. In the interview, Mr. Chew didn\\'t want to discuss what he did with his bird. After the military, Mr. Chew attended University College London and remained in the British capital to work as a banker for Goldman Sachs. Following an internship at Meta Platforms Inc.\\'s Facebook and business school, Mr. Chew worked for venture-capital firm DST Global. His high-school-level Mandarin qualified him to be its China-focused partner. In 2012, he visited the Chinese equivalent of a Silicon Valley garage: an apartment in Beijing\\'s university district. Thirty people, including a chef, crammed in to develop an app that suggested news articles to people based on factors such as how much time they spent on previous stories. The company was ByteDance, which would go on to create TikTok. Its founder, Zhang Yiming, won over Mr. Chew. He and his partners invested in the company. \"The idea is so simple but so powerful: that you should be looking at content not based on who you know, but really based on your own behavior,\" Mr. Chew said. Another investment Mr. Chew led was in Xiaomi Corp., a Chinese smartphone giant with global ambitions. Xiaomi brought him over first as chief financial officer and then had him run its business outside China.']]\n"

      "['The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has triggered a debate over the best way to support unprofitable businesses that are developing new technologies. When it comes to innovations aimed at climate change, some say government agencies should play a bigger role. Before regulators took over Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, it stood out as a lender to clean-energy companies such as residential-solar providers and fuel-cell makers, as well as developers of climate-related technologies like low-carbon cement. The bank\\'s loans to startups pale in comparison to the more than $1 trillion invested in such businesses by venture-capital firms during the past few years, according to research provider PitchBook Data Inc. The lender, however, provided an important alternative to more expensive and dilutive equity capital, according to investment bankers serving the industry. \"For better or for worse, they played a unique role in the venture-financing space,\" said Jeremy Swan, a managing principal with advisory firm CohnReznick LLP. He leads the firm\\'s financial services and sponsors practice. Silicon Valley Bank\\'s status as a federally insured depository institution has raised the question of whether it assumed too much risk by lending to early-stage and unprofitable startups. With largely unproven products, these companies often lack assets to pledge against a loan and rely on cash from venture investors, creating a mismatch between risk and return for a bank lender, said Bob Bartell, president of risk and financial consulting firm Kroll LLC\\'s corporate finance business. \"It is pretty uncommon for a [commercial] bank to make a loan to an unprofitable business if it is not collateralized by a personal guarantee of a business owner or a corporate guarantee of a larger parent company,\" Mr. Bartell said. Lending without tangible collateral means \"taking equity risk and getting paid debt returns,\" he said. Government agencies, on the other hand, can represent a more suitable source of low-cost capital to risky businesses because the support they provide usually doesn\\'t depend on profits, Arij van Berkel, a senior vice president of Lux Research Inc., said in a webinar hosted by the consulting firm. Mr. van Berkel leads Lux\\'s energy-research team. \"A government, or a government-affiliated organization, [has] other motives for taking a high risk,\" he said. \"For example, they want to meet climate goals or they want to turn their economy into a circular economy.\" Federal agencies do \"a good job\" of providing seed capital that helps entrepreneurs start new businesses. But funding dwindles during the three to seven years it can take for a startup to become attractive to venture-capital and private-equity firms, said Rita Hansen, co-founder and chief executive of Onboard Dynamics LLC. The company develops portable units that help reduce methane emissions during natural gas pipeline maintenance and other activities. Started at Oregon State University in 2013 with Energy Department backing through its Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E, Onboard later received support from angel investors. Still, Onboard struggled to fund operations before private-equity firm BP Energy Partners bought a majority stake in the business less than two years ago, Ms. Hansen said. Onboard had a Silicon Valley Bank account, but the lender considered the company to be too young for a loan, she said. \"The government has an expectation that there\\'s this big safety net of private capital that is going to catch all these new companies, but that\\'s a big mistake,\" Ms. Hansen said. She added that government funding, when available, is often \"competitive and prescriptive,\" leaving little room for a startup to make decisions on how to spend it. Clean-energy companies deploying proven technologies, such as solar systems, have better chances of benefiting from recently established federal financial incentives in areas such as infrastructure, clean energy and chip manufacturing, said Peter Davidson, chief executive of Aligned Climate Capital, a clean energy-focused firm in New York. Before setting up Aligned in 2019, Mr. Davidson led the Energy Department\\'s loan programs office during the Obama administration. \"There\\'s massive new amounts of government assistance\" becoming available under recently enacted laws, Mr. Davidson said. He also cited grants and loans offered by so-called state green banks as well as other federal sources such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Aligned Climate, for example, uses USDA loans to buy solar installations in rural areas. Ms. Hansen said early-stage startups often don\\'t have the resources to figure out how to tap government incentives and sometimes find the process too cumbersome. \"Nobody in my network of founders has found out yet how to leverage any funding from the Inflation Reduction Act,\" she said, referring to the 2022 law that established and extended tax incentives for clean-energy investments. The recently added government incentives for clean energy didn\\'t focus on early-stage startups, but the situation could change as reducing carbon emissions becomes a more pressing goal, Anthony Schiavo, a research director at Lux, said during the webinar. He said that more nondilutive, direct funding from government sources could encourage venture-capital firms to back less profitable businesses and change their traditional method of building portfolios with the idea of producing one or two very profitable startups to offset many failures. \"The VC goal or playbook was to invest in a lot of companies with the explicit outcome of trying to get to a billion-dollar startup,\" he said. \"I think [this model] is not very good for the sustainable-innovation space. In general, we need some of these technologies to work. We need to decarbonize a bunch of different sectors.\" Ms. Hansen said venture-capital firms turned down her investment pitches many times, telling her Onboard wouldn\\'t produce the return multiples of 10- or 30-times invested capital in the period that they wanted. It\\'s often hard for developers of clean-energy equipment to deliver such returns because these businesses require a large amount of capital, she said. \"We need patient capital that\\'s willing to tolerate lower returns,\" Ms. Hansen said. \"It\\'s hardware that\\'s going to solve the climate problem. It\\'s not software. It\\'s not an app.\" Write to Luis Garcia at luis.garcia@wsj.com', 'A federal judge curbed Puerto Rico bondholders\\' rights to the electric revenue generated by its public power utility, the last major public corporation in the U.S. territory still in bankruptcy after its other public debts were restructured. Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled on Wednesday that utility bondholders\\' collateral rights don\\'t extend to the current and future revenue of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa. Bondholders were deemed to have a security interest only in certain funds in Prepa\\'s reserve accounts, which represent a fraction of their claims. Judge Swain said that bondholders have only an unsecured claim to the utility\\'s future net revenue, or its excess funds after operating expenses are paid. Further proceedings are needed to value that unsecured claim, which covers the future revenue that would have become payable to bondholders over the life of Prepa\\'s $8.3 billion in municipal debt, according to the decision. Wednesday\\'s ruling grants some legal leverage to the oversight board steering Puerto Rico\\'s finances as it tries to lift the power utility out of a bankruptcy case that began in 2017. The oversight board spokesman said Wednesday it welcomed the decision as \"a significant win for Puerto Rico and its path to reliable electricity and economic growth.\" \"The oversight board is still analyzing the decision in detail to determine the implications of bondholders\\' remaining claim but will continue to work on resolving the remaining issues of Prepa\\'s debt restructuring consensually,\" the spokesman said. A spokesman for Prepa bondholders declined to comment. A bondholder group had argued in court that its security interest covered the full principal and interest amounts due on their bonds and extended to Prepa\\'s current and future net revenue. Bank lenders owed $700 million and a single bond insurer, MBIA Inc., agreed to restructuring terms for Prepa, but most bondholders haven\\'t. The oversight board has offered a baseline recovery of 50 cents on the dollar to bondholders in the form of cash and new securities, or less than that if they litigate their security interests and lose. The restructuring terms will determine how much 1.5 million residential and business customers will pay for electricity, which costs more in Puerto Rico than in any U.S. state. Energy bills are already a drain on family incomes and quality of life in Puerto Rico and are expected to increase to pay for any long-term settlement of Prepa\\'s debts. The oversight board and bondholders disagreed on how much of a rate increase customers can afford, especially those with lower incomes. Bondholders have argued that Prepa has a history of underestimating its projected sales and of viewing temporary challenges, such as the rise in oil prices, as permanent in order to drive down creditors\\' claims. Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com', 'DUBAI—Saudi Arabia and Syria are nearing an agreement to restore diplomatic ties after negotiations mediated by Russia, according to Saudi and Syrian officials familiar with the discussions, as the geopolitics of the Middle East shift. Talks were continuing after rounds of discussions in Moscow and Riyadh in recent weeks, the officials said. If a deal is reached, it would mark an important step to reintegrating Syria and its leader Bashar al-Assad into the broader region after a brutal civil war . Following the Chinese-brokered deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran on resuming ties this month, the emerging Damascus-Riyadh rapprochement, if it sticks, would leave the U.S. on the sidelines again on another major Middle East development . Saudi and Syrian officials said negotiators are aiming to conclude a deal before a potential visit by Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan to Damascus after the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr in late April. But they cautioned that the discussions could still break down. Saudi state television reported Thursday night that negotiations have started with Syria to resume offering necessary consular services for both countries, citing a source at the foreign ministry. Saudi Arabia and Syria cut ties in 2012 over Mr. Assad\\'s response to political protests that emerged from the Arab Spring uprising and his actions in the ensuing civil war. The Saudis helped orchestrate Syria\\'s ejection from the Arab League and funded rebels fighting Mr. Assad\\'s forces for years. The Russian government brokered a preliminary agreement when Mr. Assad visited Moscow last week, said officials from Saudi Arabia, Syria and other Arab countries involved. Senior Syrian officials then visited Saudi Arabia in recent weeks. If a formal agreement is reached, a vote on reintegration of Syria into the broader region and its reconstruction will be on the agenda of the next Arab League summit expected in May in Saudi Arabia, according to Arab officials. Much of the Arab world has moved to set aside the rivalries that plunged the region into chaos following uprisings that began in 2011 and toppled several Middle Eastern governments. Mr. Assad has been in talks with several Arab countries to end more than a decade of isolation, and the Saudi foreign minister recently said the status quo with Syria wasn\\'t sustainable. Iran also encouraged Syria to strike a deal with Saudi Arabia after Riyadh and Tehran agreed to resume diplomatic ties after a seven-year hiatus, said an Iranian official and Syrian government advisers. Other Arab countries such as Oman and Jordan have also backed the rapprochement between Damascus and Riyadh, said Arab officials familiar with the talks. The main focus of the talks has been security, Syrian government advisers said. The kingdom wants to resolve the issue of Saudi detainees who were captured after joining jihadist groups involved in the civil war, these people said. Damascus is seeking Riyadh\\'s help to cut off funding for and recruitment of fundamentalist factions fighting in Syria, the officials said. Any agreement between Saudi Arabia and Syria, brokered by Russia, would represent another splashy diplomatic move by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The 37-year-old who rules the oil-rich kingdom day-to-day for his aging father, King Salman, has reset relations with Washington , long the Saudi\\'s protector in the Persian Gulf, and developed closer relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping since the beginning of the Ukraine war. Prince Mohammed faced diplomatic isolation for several years after Saudi agents killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in an operation that the U.S. intelligence community concluded was ordered by the royal . The Saudi government says that Prince Mohammed wasn\\'t involved and that the perpetrators were brought to justice. Prince Mohammed has tried to avoid being pulled onto any one side since the start of the Ukraine war . He has used the war as an opportunity to forge an independent foreign policy that leverages Saudi Arabia\\'s status as the world\\'s largest oil exporter. The Syria talks come after Prince Mohammed greenlighted a detente with Iran in a deal brokered by China. \"Oil exporters and authoritarian states have more in common than the democratic West, with their use of sanctions and perceived hypocrisy on respect for sovereignty,\" said Karen Young, senior research scholar specializing in the Middle East at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. In the Middle East, she said, \"the general trend is a consensus on noninterference in domestic affairs as a principle.\" Mediating between Saudi Arabia and Syria bolsters Russia\\'s presence in the Middle East. Mr. Putin\\'s air-power intervention in the Syrian civil war proved decisive for Mr. Assad, and he has courted the Saudis, aligning oil-rich Russia with the Riyadh-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. For the U.S., the deal is a reminder that, while it remains the pre-eminent military and diplomatic force in the Middle East, its influence there is waning. The U.S. still has troops in Syria, where they are conducting antiterrorism operations in the country\\'s southeast and with Kurdish-led forces in the northeast. But Washington has long signaled that it wants to focus more on Russia and China and less on the region\\'s messy affairs, and the shift was illustrated Thursday when The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. will send aging attack planes to the Middle East and swap out the more advanced combat aircraft there now. \"The most important single factor affecting the region is the perception of American withdrawal, which creates a vacuum that other countries can step into,\" said William Wechsler, a former U.S. Defense Department official and now director of the Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs in Washington. The Middle East has undergone a dramatic realignment in recent years. The Saudis patched up a diplomatic spat with Qatar , Persian Gulf countries have begun setting aside longstanding differences with Turkey, and conflicts in Libya, Yemen and Syria have largely cooled down. The U.S. remains engaged in trying to broker a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia , but there are high hurdles. \"After the Saudi-Iran pact and now a prospective rapprochement between Syria and the kingdom, the U.S. is increasingly diplomatically sidelined,\" said Fabrice Balanche, a Middle East-focused assistant professor at the University of Lyon 2 in France. \"Middle East nations are making peace without Washington.\" For Mr. Assad, a deal with Saudi Arabia would be one of the final demonstrations that he prevailed in a grinding 11-year civil war, not just against the rebels but also against an array of foreign actors, including the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, who called for his removal from power. Mr. Assad used a devastating earthquake in his country\\'s north last month to make a push for normal diplomatic relations, visiting Oman and the United Arab Emirates in recent weeks. But he remains a pariah in most of the world, with overwhelming evidence that he used chemical weapons on Syrians and oversaw the killing of tens of thousands of civilians.

Now their investors may be a bit too hopeful that the U.S. government will do it for them. Stocks of the parent companies of TikTok\\'s main U.S. rivals jumped Thursday as Shou Zi Chew—chief executive officer of the red-hot social-media app—was grilled before Congress over a host of issues that are mostly related to the company\\'s Chinese ownership. Mr. Chew\\'s appearance before the House Energy and Commerce Committee came after the Biden administration threatened earlier this month to ban the app if the company\\'s Chinese owners didn\\'t divest their ownership stakes. The Chinese government responded Thursday, saying it would oppose any forced sale on the grounds that it would involve exporting technology that would require government approval. That appeared to increase the likelihood of an outright ban, which would come as good news to the social-media and online advertising giants that have ceded market share to TikTok over the past couple of years as the app has exploded in popularity, now reaching more than 150 million active users in the U.S. Thursday\\'s hearing was further evidence that a social app purportedly used by nearly half the U.S. population doesn\\'t have any friends in Washington. Committee members from both political parties roundly voiced concerns about TikTok\\'s Chinese ownership and expressed strong skepticism of the company\\'s stated plan to hive off data on U.S. users with the help of Oracle. \"Your platform should be banned,\" said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the committee\\'s Republican chair. \"I still believe that the Beijing communist government will still control and have the ability to influence what you do,\" said Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the panel\\'s top Democrat. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Snapchat parent Snap, Google parent Alphabet and Pinterest have seen their stocks average a 10% gain since March 15, when The Wall Street Journal reported the threat from the Biden administration. That is more than twice the Nasdaq Composite\\'s gains in that time. Together with Amazon, those companies generated more than $380 billion in online advertising revenue last year. But that was up only 6% from the previous year—a notable slump from the 28% annual growth averaged over the previous five years. So the prospect of having a formidable competitor being taken out of circulation is heartening, especially in a market that isn\\'t expected to turn back up anytime soon. Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik estimates that TikTok is on track to generate between $7 billion and $8 billion in revenue in the U.S. alone next year. He named Meta and Alphabet, which also owns TikTok competitor YouTube, as the companies most likely to benefit from a TikTok ban, but added that \"some ad dollars may just go back into ad buyer pockets or look for an experimental platform outside our cohort.\" Experienced D.C. watchers say it is still far from certain whether such a ban can even be enacted—and if it will stick. \"We remain below 50% that TikTok is ultimately banned in the U.S.,\" wrote Paul Gallant, policy analyst for TD Cowen, in a report Wednesday. Matt Perault of New Street Research notes that TikTok could challenge any ban on First Amendment grounds, which would result in a lengthy court battle at the very least. Mr. Chew may have gotten buried by political grandstanding on Thursday. But for investors, it is still too early to be dancing on TikTok\\'s grave. Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com', 'WASHINGTON—Top progressive Democrats said they have disagreements with President Biden but remain staunch supporters headed into the 2024 election, after moves by the administration on issues such as crime, immigration and energy policy angered the party\\'s left wing. Mr. Biden sided with Republicans on overturning Washington, D.C.\\'s crime code , prompting howls from progressives for stepping on home rule, and the White House has drawn scrutiny for considering a return to a policy of detaining migrant families who cross illegally into the U.S. The administration also approved the Willow oil-drilling project over the objections of environmentalists. Progressive lawmakers and activists criticized the moves, but the blowback has been limited. No major protests have emerged outside the White House, like those seen during former President Barack Obama\\'s administration , and there has been no talk of a serious primary challenger from the progressive flank. Many see Mr. Biden as critical to winning the coming presidential race and helping take back full control of Congress, even if they aren\\'t always on the same page. \"I\\'m opposed to the Willow project, which will mean fossil-fuel drilling on federal land, and I do think the president will need to have a bold climate policy to mobilize young voters in 2024,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), a progressive who is considering running for Senate next year. Still, on the presidential race, Mr. Khanna said: \"I\\'ll be backing him enthusiastically.\" Progressives have been the loudest voices within the party on matters including policing, LGBT issues, economic opportunity and protecting the environment. Mr. Biden ran in 2020 as a seasoned centrist but has worked with progressives on many of their priorities—including passing a bill designed to slow climate change and taking executive action to trim student loans. \"It\\'s no secret that the president wasn\\'t my first choice in 2020,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.) who leads the House progressives. But after working together she plans to support him in 2024. She said progressives will continue to \"push where we need to push.\" A recent NBC/PBS NewsHour poll said that 50% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents think Democrats have a better chance of winning the White House if Mr. Biden is the nominee, compared with 45% who think the party would do better with someone else. Mr. Biden is expected to formally announce he is running later this year. The White House said it is in regular touch with progressive leaders on Capitol Hill. With House Democrats now in the minority, progressives are pressuring Mr. Biden to take more executive actions, bypassing Congress. Staff for the Congressional Progressive Caucus met with the White House\\'s Office of Legislative Affairs on Tuesday to talk about their wish list , which includes a range of demands, from expanding worker overtime protections to declaring a national climate emergency. Last year, progressives pressed Mr. Biden to cancel student loan debt. Ultimately Mr. Biden issued an executive order to cancel up to $20,000 in debt , short of what some progressives wanted. The Supreme Court is expected to decide the fate of the program by late June. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) both ran against Mr. Biden in the 2020 Democratic primary, proposing student-loan forgiveness and expanded government health coverage. They now back Mr. Biden if he seeks another term. \"I think what the progressive movement in the country has done is to show the political establishment that millions of people are tired of status quo politics,\" said Mr. Sanders. \"Is he doing everything that I would like? No, but I think he has heard that message,\" he said. \"I thought they were wrong,\" Ms. Warren said of the president\\'s recent moves on immigration, drilling and crime, while praising his actions on climate and corporate taxes. \"Joe Biden and I don\\'t agree on everything, but I\\'m really glad he\\'s president of the U.S.,\" she said on NBC News. The White House cited Mr. Biden\\'s recently released budget , which proposes child care, paid leave and free community college, as showing shared goals. But the White House is also trying to take a tough line on issues such as crime and illegal immigration that Republicans make clear will be a focus in 2024. The Biden administration has crossed progressives on a string of issues in recent months. The administration approved the Willow oil-drilling project in the Alaskan Arctic, arguing it had limited legal options and stressed that the president has moved to block future oil and gas leasing in the Arctic Ocean\\'s federal waters. On immigration, the administration is considering a return to a policy of detaining migrant families as it looks to more restrictive policies to control the southern border. The White House said no decision has been made yet on family detention. On the D.C. crime bill, many Democrats were upset because they felt blindsided. The White House initially said it opposed the bill but then pivoted and said Mr. Biden would sign it. The White House said Mr. Biden never issued an explicit veto threat and emphasized his record of supporting funding for public safety. \"Our view is this is like a family,\" said White House Legislative Affairs Director Louisa Terrell of the D.C. bill. \"We have Democrats on the House side and Democrats on the Senate side, and we are a family, and we have heard this, and we\\'ve talked it through, and we\\'re now two weeks later, and we\\'re moving on,\" she said. Write to Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com and Natalie Andrews at natalie.andrews@wsj.com', 'TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has kept out of the limelight until recently. PHOTO: Alyssa Schukar for The Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON—TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Zi Chew has navigated both Western and Chinese business over the course of his fast rise to the corner office. That cultural straddle has helped land him the top job at one of the world\\'s biggest tech companies. His background also provided a potential connection with a skeptical American Congress . Many members have threatened to ban TikTok, saying its Chinese ownership poses a national-security threat . But on Thursday, the 40-year-old Singaporean army reservist and former Goldman Sachs banker faced a hostile House panel as he tried to reassure Americans their data is safe and Beijing won\\'t be able to influence what viewers see on TikTok. Hours before the testimony, Beijing said it would oppose a forced sale of the app from its Chinese owners, something the Biden administration has demanded . That amped up the hearing\\'s geopolitical dimensions, thrusting Mr. Chew into the middle of souring U.S.-China relations. House lawmakers then pummeled TikTok\\'s chief executive over the popular app\\'s ties to China. The congressional hearing was peppered with withering attacks on TikTok from both Democrats and Republicans, running more than five hours and underscoring growing concern about Beijing\\'s potential influence over the app. Born and raised in Singapore, then educated in London and at Harvard Business School, Mr. Chew spent some of his early career cutting deals for a venture-capital firm in Asia. He then quickly moved to the C-suite as the chief financial officer of a Chinese smartphone giant at age 32. He runs TikTok from offices in Singapore, but travels often, including frequently to the U.S. He met his wife, a Taiwanese-American who grew up in Bethesda, Md., at Harvard. Relatively unknown for the boss of one of the world\\'s most popular apps, Mr. Chew was sharply questioned by some of the company\\'s more skeptical critics on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Aides to the Republicans who control the committee say there is essentially nothing Mr. Chew can say that would change their minds as they threaten a nationwide ban. In an interview from the company\\'s WeWork offices in Washington, he said he views Thursday\\'s hearing as a chance to explain what TikTok is trying to do, and to get feedback from Congress members—not a last-gasp effort to save TikTok\\'s American business. \"I look at it as an opportunity to do that, not a do-or-die\" moment, he said. The corporate stakes for Mr. Chew are as high as they get for a CEO facing such an appearance in Washington. Some Congress members from both major parties are pushing for a nationwide ban of the video app, citing national-security threats. The Biden administration is demanding TikTok divest itself from its Chinese parent ByteDance Ltd. or face such a ban. Critics say China could force TikTok to hand over American user data or influence what American viewers see on the app. TikTok has said it has never received such a request and would refuse to comply with one. Mr. Chew took over the top job after Kevin Mayer, a high-profile Walt Disney Co. alum, left his post after three months, while the Trump administration pursued an earlier effort to force a sale of TikTok to U.S. investors. He is a native English speaker who, like most Singaporeans, is of Chinese ancestry. His father worked in construction and his mother in bookkeeping. He said he was uprooted from a modest upbringing at age 12, when high marks on a national exam sent him to an elite high school. Mr. Chew was put on an officer track during his mandatory 2½ years of military service. That added 10 years to his eligibility for reserve duty, which ends when he is 50. The hardest physical experience of his life, he said, was the military\\'s five-day survival course in Brunei\\'s jungles. He built a hut, cooked wild yams and trekked 55 miles. At one point during such courses, trainees are given a live quail that they can kill with their hands before skinning and cooking it. In the interview, Mr. Chew didn\\'t want to discuss what he did with his bird. After the military, Mr. Chew attended University College London and remained in the British capital to work as a banker for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Following an internship at Meta Platforms Inc.\\'s Facebook and business school, Mr. Chew worked for venture-capital firm DST Global. His high-school-level Mandarin qualified him to be its China-focused partner. In 2012, he visited the Chinese equivalent of a Silicon Valley garage: an apartment in Beijing\\'s university district. Thirty people, including a chef, crammed in to develop an app that suggested news articles to people based on factors such as how much time they spent on previous stories. The company was ByteDance Ltd ., which would later go on to create TikTok. Its founder, a young Zhang Yiming, won over Mr. Chew. He and his partners invested in the company. \"The idea is so simple but so powerful: that you should be looking at content not based on who you know, but really based on your own behavior,\" Mr. Chew said. Another investment Mr. Chew led was in Xiaomi Corp., a Chinese smartphone giant with global ambitions. Xiaomi brought him over first as chief financial officer, and then had him run its business outside China. One thing that stood out among colleagues was his grasp of both Chinese and Western business cultures. \"He\\'s perfectly bicultural,\" said Hugo Barra, a former Xiaomi executive who worked with Mr. Chew. \"That\\'s a critical asset for an executive of a Chinese company trying to become a global company.\" Mr. Chew led Xiaomi to an initial public offering in 2018, but its shares struggled immediately afterward, during a difficult financial period for Chinese tech companies. In 2021, Mr. Zhang, who had kept in touch with Mr. Chew, asked the Singaporean to become the finance chief of ByteDance, which in addition to TikTok operates other popular Chinese apps. Mr. Chew did that for two months until he and the founder decided he would be better off running TikTok. TikTok has rolled out billions of dollars of spending aimed at siloing off the app from its Chinese owners, and it said it would hire Oracle Corp. to independently monitor against any interference by Beijing. The measures amount to what the company says is an unprecedented effort to assure Americans their data is safe—one that keeps TikTok unprofitable for now. TikTok faces the ban from Washington while it continues to be hugely popular across the country. Mr. Chew, in his own TikTok video on Tuesday, appealed directly to American users, calling attention to the possible ban. In the video he said the app had 150 million users in the U.S., almost half the country\\'s population. Mr. Chew said he accepted the commerce committee\\'s invitation because he wanted to address misconceptions about TikTok, both to Congress and the American public. \"There are some things [being said] that are outright just wrong about our company, and we do need to clarify it,\" he said in the interview. Write to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com', 'General Mills, maker of Cheerios and other food brands, said consumers have taken higher prices in stride this year. PHOTO: Kristen Norman for The Wall Street Journal General Mills Inc. executives said inflation isn\\'t letting up, but customers are sticking with its products despite higher prices in grocery stores. The Minneapolis-based maker of Cheerios and Betty Crocker cake mix said Thursday that it expects cost increases to moderate but remain above normal in the company\\'s fiscal 2024, which begins later this year. General Mills expects expenses tied to labor, energy and the company\\'s suppliers to keep cost inflation in the mid-single digits, compared with about 14% to 15% this fiscal year. \"The environment remains challenging and dynamic,\" said Jeff Harmening, General Mills\\' chief executive. General Mills executives said that while prices for some key raw commodities have declined from their recent peaks, costs incurred by suppliers that turn those commodities into products for the company are expected to remain elevated. Still, General Mills said consumers have taken higher prices in stride this year more than they have historically. General Mills on Thursday boosted its outlook for sales and profits after revenue rose 13% in its latest quarter, driven largely by higher prices. The amount of food the company sold globally was flat, including declines in its North American retail and international businesses. Mr. Harmening said consumers are still eating at home more than they did before the pandemic, and that General Mills sees that continuing. Consumers have seen their grocery bills surge as food makers have passed on what executives have said are climbing costs for ingredients, transportation and labor. Higher prices have helped boost sales for food manufacturers such as Kellogg Co. and Kraft Heinz Co., but they have often chipped away at volumes. Containing such rising costs is a central part of the Federal Reserve\\'s efforts to bring down inflation that remains stubbornly high. The consumer-price index, a closely watched inflation gauge, rose 6% in February from a year earlier, down from a 6.4% gain the prior month, according to the Labor Department. It was the smallest increase since September 2021. Food inflation has begun to slow , though U.S. grocery prices were still up 10% in February from a year earlier, the Labor Department said. An index for meats, poultry, fish and eggs fell 0.1% in February, the first decrease since December 2021. An index for eggs alone fell 6.7%. Sales at General Mills\\' North America retail division, which includes U.S. groceries, rose 15% in the quarter, which ended Feb. 26. The company said its products have gained market share in cereal, refrigerated dough, fruit snacks, soup and seasoning categories this year, as it has ratcheted up marketing spending. Rising costs hurt operating profit in the company\\'s pet food business, though sales in that unit also increased. \"The consumer seems to be reasonably robust,\" Mr. Harmening said. While private-label products, which are typically cheaper than brand-name equivalents, picked up market share during the last economic recession, Mr. Harmening said, General Mills was able to hang on to its share. General Mills\\' exposure to private-label products remains lower than average, which bodes well for its future, he said. General Mills shares closed 2.9% higher on Thursday. For the full year, General Mills now forecasts organic sales , which exclude acquisitions, divestitures and the impact of currency translation, rising between 10% and 11%, slightly higher than the outlook it gave last month. Per-share earnings are expected to rise 8% to 9% on an adjusted basis, also a slight increase. General Mills posted earnings of $553.1 million, or 92 cents a share, for the most recent quarter, down from $660.3 million, or $1.08 a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings were 97 cents a share, above analysts\\' estimates of 92 cents. Denny Jacob contributed to this article.

Ole Miss had little to lose, having won exactly one Southeastern Conference game the season before. Five years later, McPhee-McCuin and her No. 8-seeded Rebels engineered one of the NCAA women\\'s tournament\\'s biggest upsets, beating perennial power and No. 1 seed Stanford on Sunday. The Rebels face No. 5 Louisville on Friday in the Sweet 16. While women\\'s college basketball has been dominated by dynastic coaches or those who\\'ve played in the Olympics, McPhee-McCuin is \"out of the mud,\" she said. She grew up in the Caribbean nation of the Bahamas, whose entire national population of 408,000 wouldn\\'t quite fill the stands over an eight-game home season of Ole Miss football. McPhee-McCuin had an unremarkable college career—Miami-Dade Community College, followed by Rhode Island—then clambered up a splintery coaching ladder to become the reigning NCAA women\\'s tournament darling. McPhee-McCuin\\'s route included crisscrossing the U.S. to unglamorous assistant jobs: a junior college in the Texas panhandle city of Borger, nicknamed \"Booger Town\"; Arkansas-Pine Bluff; the University of Portland (Ore.); Pittsburgh; and Clemson before landing her first head coaching job, at Jacksonville. \"I always use, like, basketball analogies, and I say: For my life, y\\'all, I never get a wide-open layup,\" McPhee-McCuin said. \"I always have to do a pro-hop or a Euro step to score in life.\" Coach Yo, as she\\'s known, had a knack for connecting with people, though—precious currency in the player recruitment that drives college basketball. She told the Coach JB Show podcast this week: \"I don\\'t know that I\\'m ever going to be googly-eyes over the McDonald\\'s All-American. Give me the Wendy\\'s All-American all day, every day.\" It was a journey to an actual fast-food restaurant that helped land one of her most important recruits. Kayla Gordon, a standout at Meridian (Miss.) High in the early 2010s, recalled that she was a homebody with no interest in leaving the state. But Coach Yo wanted her on the team in Jacksonville, about an eight-hour drive away. So one day, McPhee-McCuin surprised Gordon by walking into the Chick-fil-A where she worked. As the two chatted, Gordon said she marveled at the steps McPhee-McCuin had taken: calling her mom to find out when she was working, making the trip, showing up and showing Gordon how much she valued her. \"I\\'m like, \\'Wow, I feel special,\\'\" Gordon recalled. Gordon played four years at Jacksonville, leading the team in rebounding her senior year. After school she took two more leaps inspired by Coach Yo: The former homebody went to Europe, playing professionally in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Finland. And Gordon went into coaching. She\\'s now an assistant women\\'s basketball coach at Jacksonville. Ross Bjork, the Ole Miss athletic director in 2018, said that Coach Yo was on Mississippi\\'s list of potential women\\'s basketball coaches—a list 25 people long. As he interviewed candidates, said Bjork, now Texas A&M\\'s athletic director, a representative of the search firm hired by the school reminded him, \"Hey, don\\'t forget about Coach Yo.\" That representative, now TurnkeyZRG managing director Chad Chatlos, said McPhee-McCuin was, \"just was like a bulldog: \\'Put me in front of the AD. I won\\'t let you down.\\' Yolett just had this perfect blend of being aggressive but being respectful of the process.\" Bjork and an Ole Miss colleague finally set up a FaceTime call with McPhee-McCuin and, Bjork said, \"She, like, jumped through the screen with her energy and passion.\" Coach Yo was also fearless, something he needed in a coach coming into a tough conference for a rebuilding job. McPhee-McCuin muddled through two rough seasons—9-22, 7-23—before pushing Ole Miss above .500 in 2021, then to the NCAA tournament\\'s first round in 2022. This season, the Rebels narrowly lost against SEC power LSU and defending NCAA champion South Carolina. Then came the second-round NCAA upset of Stanford and a spontaneous celebration by all the people who\\'ve been in Coach Yo\\'s orbit. The Bahamas Basketball Federation, for which McPhee-McCuin has coached the women\\'s national team and assisted in coaching the men\\'s team, congratulated her on its social-media sites. College football talk-show king Paul Finebaum had her on . Fellow Bahamian and WNBA star Jonquel Jones of the New York Liberty tweeted a video of herself dancing and saying, \"We just knocked out a No. 1 seed!\" Jones later explained in an interview: \"The Bahamas is a small country, so it\\'s \\'we.\\' We take our wins wherever we can get them.\" Jones—a four-time WNBA All-Star and the 2021 league MVP—said that McPhee-McCuin\\'s father, a legendary high school coach named Gladstone \"Moon\" McPhee, \"basically taught me everything I know about basketball.\" There were few games or tournaments for girls in the Bahamas, Jones said, so players had to fit into boys\\' schedules or train by themselves. As a teenager Yolett woke her father at 5 a.m. each weekday and they would head to an outdoor court to get a workout in. Then she would go home to clean up in time for her mother, Daisy, who was also the school principal, to unlock the school gates at 7 a.m., according to the Mississippi Clarion-Ledger . The Rebels took down Stanford the old-school way: with defense and free throws. Ole Miss forward Madison Scott recalled that Coach Yo had said the key to beating the Cardinal on their court—the women\\'s tournament awards higher-seeded teams with early-round home games—was improving on the Rebels\\' shooting from the line, a dismal 67.3% this season. \"Before we left, we were in Oxford (Miss.) shooting free throws every day before practice, after practice,\" Scott said. It paid off: Ole Miss made 11 of 14 free throws against Stanford. The Rebels won, 54-49. Jones said she was moved as she watched an on-court interview where Coach Yo called herself a \"little girl from the Bahamas that was given an opportunity\" and dedicated the win to \"people with a dollar and a dream.\" \"Of course, that\\'s going to resonate with so many other people, not just Bahamians, who have big dreams but they don\\'t necessarily know how they can get from point A to point B,\" Jones said. \"So for her to be able to share those stories is, you know, that\\'s what it\\'s all about. That\\'s what sports is all about.\" Write to Rachel Bachman at Rachel.Bachman@wsj.com', 'U.S.-China relations were dealt another blow as lawmakers at a House hearing pressed TikTok\\'s chief executive on the popular app\\'s ties to China, and as Beijing said it would fight any U.S. attempt to force the company\\'s sale by its Chinese owners. The hearing Thursday, peppered with withering attacks on TikTok from both Democrats and Republicans, ran more than five hours and underscored growing concern about Beijing\\'s potential influence over the app. U.S.-China relations are already frayed over trade, Taiwan, technology and geopolitical rivalries. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, seated in front of U.S. TikTok executives and popular stars on the platform, sought to reassure lawmakers that the company would earn their trust. \"Our approach has never been to dismiss or trivialize any of these concerns. We have addressed them with real action,\" he said. Rep. Frank Pallone (D., N.J.), the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, issued a blunt response to Mr. Chew\\'s claims. \"I don\\'t buy it,\" Mr. Pallone said. The committee\\'s chairwoman, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.), called for banning the app , which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. The bipartisan skepticism further clouded the future of a platform that TikTok says is now used by 150 million Americans . Hours before the hearing, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would \"firmly oppose\" the Biden administration\\'s recent demand that TikTok\\'s Chinese owners sell their stakes or face a possible ban. U.S. lawmakers pointed to that statement as evidence that the company was beholden to Beijing. TikTok\\'s travails have put it at the center of strained ties between the world\\'s two great economic powers as they quarrel over issues including trade policy, surveillance and technological development. Washington has stepped up sanctions against Chinese companies, and Beijing has deployed regulatory enforcement and other pressure tactics against American businesses. The resulting trade blacklists have swept up China-based telecommunications companies Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., as well as U.S. defense contractors Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Technologies Corp. \"The TikTok battles are indicative of the end of an era,\" said Lindsay Gorman, senior fellow for emerging technologies at the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, and a former Biden White House adviser. \"This era where U.S.-China business relations can continue absent considerations of geopolitics is over.\" The U.S. concerns over TikTok have partly stemmed from increased involvement in business activities by the Chinese government. Under leader Xi Jinping, China\\'s party-state has adopted laws and regulations to ensure its access to data collected by private firms, and expanded efforts to influence corporate governance and decision-making. China has also blocked U.S. social media and information sites including Alphabet Inc.\\'s Google and the Meta Platforms Inc.\\'s Facebook. A fund backed by China\\'s cybersecurity watchdog holds a 1% stake in the core subsidiary of TikTok\\'s Chinese parent, Bytedance Ltd., a what is called \"golden share\" that gives the regulator a board seat at the subsidiary, voting power and sway over its business decisions. Under questioning from Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R., Texas), Mr. Chew said that under the company\\'s security plan, TikTok\\'s data would be stored in the U.S. and controlled by a U.S. company, alleviating the concern. Mr. Crenshaw responded: \"I want to say this to all the teenagers out there and TikTok influencers who think we\\'re just old and out of touch and…. trying to take away your favorite app. You may not care that your data is being accessed now, but it will be one day when you do care about it.\" Mrs. Rodgers opened the questioning Thursday by asking Mr. Chew to state \"with 100% certainty\" that the Chinese government couldn\\'t use TikTok or ByteDance to surveil Americans or manipulate the content Americans see. Mr. Chew said the company was committed to firewalling U.S. user data from \"all unwanted foreign access\" and would keep content \"free from any manipulation from any government.\" \"If you can\\'t say it 100% certain, I take that as a \\'no,\\'\" Mrs. Rodgers shot back. \"I have zero confidence in your assertion that ByteDance and TikTok are not beholden to the [Chinese Communist Party].\" In his testimony , Mr. Chew said TikTok is spending $1.5 billion to create the firewall of U.S. data, leaving \"American data stored on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel.\" When that process is complete, he said, it should eliminate lawmakers\\' concern that some TikTok user data could be subject to Chinese law—though he said engineers globally could access it as required for business purposes. Asked about a possible sale, Mr. Chew said he didn\\'t think a change in ownership would improve safety and security, pointing to the privacy problems of U.S. tech platforms. Mr. Chew also said the platform would work to ensure a safe environment for young people, another concern of committee members. Rep. Bob Latta (R., Ohio) said TikTok had been insulated from legal claims arising from the death of a 10-year-old girl who had participated in a breath-holding challenge that was popular on TikTok. Mr. Latta questioned why TikTok should be protected by federal law shielding websites when it amplifies \"dangerous and life-threatening content to children.\" Mr. Chew said that the platform has taken a number of proactive steps to better protect children—including measures that go beyond those employed by other platforms. Accounts registered to teens under 16 are set to private by default, and they also can\\'t send direct messages. Their content is ineligible for recommendation in the app\\'s popular \"For You\" tab. He said dealing with harmful content was an industrywide challenge. Some lawmakers asked Mr. Chew if he agreed that China\\'s government has persecuted the Uyghur ethnic group, which U.S. officials have characterized as a genocide. Mr. Chew answered by saying content about that issue was available on TikTok. After the testimony ended, TikTok spokeswoman Brooke Oberwetter said that political grandstanding had dominated the hearing, ignoring the solutions TikTok was working on to protect user data and keep content harmful to young people off the site. The hearing shed little light on how Congress might address the numerous problems with TikTok that lawmakers highlighted. Several bills are under consideration in Congress that would ban TikTok outright, typically by prohibiting U.S. companies from doing business with it. Some would also allow the government to ban or restrict other apps with ties to hostile foreign governments. Several lawmakers also urged renewed consideration of comprehensive privacy legislation. An actual ban on TikTok faces practical and legal hurdles, and two federal judges struck down former President Donald Trump\\'s earlier attempts to do so. Any crackdown carries political risks, particularly for Democrats who tend to get more support from the younger people who are TikTok\\'s dominant audience. Democrats appeared less inclined than Republicans to support an outright ban on the app, at least for now. Three Democrats appeared Wednesday with a group of TikTok stars to protest calls to ban the app. But a number of lawmakers from both parties expressed interest in a sale of TikTok\\'s Chinese ownership. Rep. Lori Trahan (D., Mass.) said near the end of Thursday\\'s hearing that Mr. Chew had fallen short of gaining lawmakers\\' trust. \"To me, it hasn\\'t happened so far,\" she said. Rep. Randy Weber (R., Tex.) took a similar-sounding tone. \"If this committee has its way,\" he said, \"TikTok\\'s time is up.\" \\u200bLingling Wei, Stu Woo, Grace Zhu and Raffaele Huang contributed to this article.

McKinnon at John.McKinnon@wsj.com and Georgia Wells at georgia.wells@wsj.com', 'Virginia-based power company AES Corp. says it is ready to push the button on a solar-panel order of more than $1 billion if a manufacturer will commit to building a factory in the U.S. If that factory gets built, AES can buy its panels and apply for federal subsidies recently made available to clean-energy developers that use equipment made in the U.S. There is one problem: The government hasn\\'t decided what \"made in the U.S.\" means, and how strictly to define it. \"You can\\'t sign on the dotted line until this is clarified,\" said Andrés Gluski, AES\\'s chief executive. The company and two other developers have said they would collectively buy as much as $6 billion in panels from a manufacturer that sets up in the U.S. Just what qualifies as made in America is one of the biggest questions still hanging over the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed in August that offers hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits and other incentives for clean-energy projects . The issue is more complicated than it might seem, given that almost all clean-energy projects require at least some parts that are manufactured overseas. The law is supposed to spur not only the deployment of clean energy but also the creation of domestic jobs and industries to underpin that rollout. So lawmakers sprinkled support for U.S.-made products throughout the legislation—from rebates for buying electric vehicles that contain significant domestic content to bonus tax credits for solar or wind developers that use enough U.S.-manufactured equipment. \"If we\\'re going to use federal tax dollars, we\\'re going to direct that investment into the United States and create American jobs,\" said John Podesta, senior adviser to President Biden for clean-energy innovation and implementation, at a Houston energy conference in early March. \"We\\'ve for too long let our supply chains drift overseas, particularly to China.\" As much as half of potentially $500 billion-plus in investment generated by the Inflation Reduction Act\\'s incentives include some sort of domestic-content requirements or bonus, according to an analysis by research institute Rhodium Group. The money at stake has made defining what it would take to meet those requirements one of the most hotly contested aspects of the law, spurring complaints from governments as well as tussles among companies ranging from U.S. steelmaker Nucor Corp. to power company NextEra Energy Inc.—all of which are angling for as much of the green subsidies as possible. The details are being completed by the Treasury Department and are expected to come out over the next few months. The rules on one important incentive— a $7,500 tax rebate for electric-vehicle purchases , if the cars and their batteries meet domestic content and sourcing requirements—are expected by the end of this month. Meanwhile, many would-be investors are hanging back. In solar, wind and storage projects alone, about $20 billion in investment could be on hold while the government sorts out a variety of tax-credit details, with much of the attention on domestic-content rules, say clean-energy analysts. A big challenge is that much of the manufacturing the law is trying to spur barely exists in the U.S. today, from the silicon ingots and special glass needed for solar panels to the large steel plates for offshore wind arrays. The bulk of those products and components are instead imported from overseas, particularly China , which offers cheaper prices and controls the supply chain for goods such as solar panels and batteries. Defining \"made in America\" in a way that excludes most of those imports could mean nobody would meet domestic-content requirements or get the incentives tied to them, some green-energy developers say. Take solar projects, which under the legislation could in some cases receive 10% more in bonus tax credits if enough of the equipment by value is made domestically. That incentive has sparked a furious debate over solar panels, which alone can comprise 40% of the total equipment cost of a solar plant and are crucial to getting the bonus. Companies such as NextEra, the U.S.\\'s biggest developer of solar projects, are urging that panels assembled in the U.S. be considered American-made, even if the ingredients come from overseas. Such a definition would let more developers get bonus credits and encourage the construction of more solar farms, they reason. Developers need those bonus credits to offset higher panel costs that would come with moving more of the solar supply chain to the U.S., says AES clean-energy head Leonardo Moreno. Companies such as South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group\\'s Qcells unit, which is planning a U.S. factory for panel components such as solar cells, disagree. A solar panel shouldn\\'t be defined as U.S.-made if its most important pieces, especially the cells that convert sunlight to electricity, are made overseas, Hanwha said, in public comments submitted to the Treasury Department. Those components tend to be particularly costly and challenging to make, so the U.S. won\\'t be able to build a domestic solar supply chain unless renewable-power developers are nudged to buy panels that use them, said Michael Carr, a partner at government-affairs consulting firm Boundary Stone Partners, which is lobbying for some manufacturers. Another contentious point is how to treat equipment made of iron and steel, such as the tower that holds up the engine and blades of a wind turbine. The legislation says the iron and steel should be made in America for a renewable-energy project to qualify for domestic-content bonuses, but is vague on exactly what that means. BCI Steel makes tubes for solar-panel trackers in Leetsdale, Pa. U.S. steelmakers say equipment that uses imported steel shouldn\\'t count as being made in America. PHOTO: Ross Mantle for The Wall Street Journal Many renewable-energy developers are pushing for a domestic-content definition that would let them import many of those steel components. Such a definition would \"effectively nullify any benefit at all in the IRA,\" said Robert DeFrancesco, a lawyer at Wiley Rein LLP who is counsel for the Wind Tower Trade Coalition, a handful of big U.S. manufacturers. U.S. steelmakers have also weighed in, especially because the clean-energy industry\\'s demand for steel is expected to triple by 2030, according to some estimates. Developers \"shouldn\\'t get the credit that was intended to benefit American workers if they are bringing [steel] from overseas,\" said Al Behr, Nucor\\'s executive vice president for plate and structural steel. Write to Phred Dvorak at phred.dvorak@wsj.com', 'Hedge funds that bet on big-picture market moves have been hit with steep losses as a spate of recent bank failures upends bets that interest rates would remain elevated. The souring of the wager led some, including Maniyar Capital Advisors and Haidar Capital Management, to lose more than 20% this month. Many of the funds, which had notched big gains as rates marched steadily upward in 2022, are now flat to down for the year following a steep recent drop in Treasury yields. So-called trend-followers, which try to take advantage of momentum in markets, also were hurt. Some macro funds sustained lesser losses. Bridgewater Associates\\'s flagship Pure Alpha fund had lost a little more than 3% in March through Friday in its higher-volatility share class, while Switzerland-based EDL Capital, started by former Moore Capital Management money manager Edouard de Langlade, lost 5%, said people familiar with the firms. Overall, macro hedge funds lost an average 3.5% in the period, according to data from research firm HFR. Macro investors since late 2021 had widely been betting that stubbornly high inflation and a tight job market would cause the Federal Reserve to raise rates faster and for longer than previously expected. Instead, recent banking turmoil put a dent in rate expectations, with the yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note notching its largest weekly decline since 1987 last week. (Yields fall as bond prices rise.) Bonds also surged overseas. Traders say losses funds were taking on their bets against Treasurys spread to Japanese government bonds as managers unwound similar bets in efforts to curb losses. Many of the funds use leverage, or borrowed money, to amplify their bets, which can boost gains if the wagers pay off but prove costly if they sour. \"The magnitude of the losses really boils down to the fact that this was a levered trade that abruptly unwound,\" said Greg Dowling, chief investment officer of investment-consulting firm Fund Evaluation Group. In the span of some 48 hours in early March, Silicon Valley Bank\\'s collapse changed investors\\' expectations about the path of interest rates in the U.S., Mr. Dowling said. Where investors previously expected that the Federal Reserve would continue to raise rates, they suddenly were confronted with the possibility that the central bank would ease up, fearing a banking crisis could tip the U.S. economy into recession . Such regime shifts are usually accompanied by months of changing data and messaging from the Federal Reserve. The Fed on Wednesday approved a quarter-percentage-point rate increase but signaled it might be done hiking sooner than previously expected, causing Treasury yields to slip further. London-based Maniyar, a macro hedge fund partly owned by Paul Tudor Jones, lost 22% for the month through Friday, according to people familiar with the firm. Haidar\\'s Jupiter fund, which gained 193% in 2022, lost 32% for the period, said a person familiar with the firm. Bloomberg News earlier reported Haidar\\'s loss. Among trend followers, which also profited by betting on higher rates last year, the Tactical Trend fund of the $18 billion Graham Capital Management lost about 10% for the month through Friday, said people familiar with the firm. Stockholm-based Lynx Asset Management\\'s diversified trend-following strategy, the Lynx Program, also lost roughly 10% for the period. Rob Christian, investment chief at K2 Advisors, a Franklin Templeton unit that invests more than $10 billion of client money in hedge funds, said some giveback of outsize gains was to be expected for trend followers, officially known as commodity trading advisers, or CTAs. \"I always tell people you have to have an iron stomach to invest in CTAs,\" he said. A rare fund that profited is $1 billion Key Square Capital Management, based in Greenwich, Conn. In a March 13 investor letter, founder Scott Bessent, a former investment chief for George Soros, wrote that Key Square the prior week had increased its funds\\' exposures to gold and safe-haven currencies, shorted bank stocks and pulled back on energy exposure. Mr. Bessent since late last year had warned his clients that banks could face losses in their fixed-income and structured-products portfolios. SVB\\'s failed attempt to sell shares before it collapsed the week of March 6 was a signal to Mr. Bessent that Fed rate increases were causing stress in the financial sector, he wrote. It was one of several \"signposts\" that prompted him to further position Key Square\\'s portfolio for deepening turmoil. A person familiar with the firm said Key Square\\'s main hedge fund was up 2.5% for the month through Friday. Another fund employing more leverage had gained 5%.

Executives in the industry are betting it is worth drilling again in some of the hardest places to do business in the world as Europe increasingly turns to other sources for its energy needs after shunning its main supplier, Russia, over the invasion of Ukraine . In recent months, a string of European officials have visited the region to help advance talks over potential supply deals. Halliburton and Honeywell International Inc. are hammering out $1.4 billion worth of deals to develop an oil field and refinery with National Oil Corporation in Libya, which has the largest known oil reserves in Africa, according to the chairman of state-owned firm, Farhat Bengdara. Italy\\'s Eni is planning investments aimed at replacing nearly half of the gas it was importing from Russia with gas from Algeria. Chevron is also looking to seal an energy exploration deal in Algeria, The Wall Street Journal reported last month . In January, the U.S. oil major announced a sizable natural-gas discovery in Egypt. \"North Africa has been slow to develop its potential because of political risks, either related to insecurity or bureaucracy,\" said Geoff Porter, president of U.S.-based North Africa Risk Consulting Inc. But with Europe needing to replace Russian energy , \"this is their moment,\" he said. Western oil executives say they see a more stable political climate in North Africa, especially in countries such as Libya where fighting between local militias has been subdued in the past two years following nearly a decade of civil war. Many American firms had pulled back from the region, viewing it as politically too risky, to focus on shale production at home. The region\\'s proximity to Europe and massive reserves, with Algeria holding the third-largest recoverable shale resources in the world, also make doing business there worth the risk, they say. At the same time, state-owned firms in the North African region have been eager to strike deals, as they see an opportunity to fill a gap left by Russia and take advantage of higher global commodity prices. Some countries, such as Egypt, are eager to bring in additional revenue from selling energy, as their economies struggle with higher import costs including for food . The Ukraine war has disrupted shipments and pushed up global commodity prices. \"I think we can be a good replacement for Russian gas to Europe,\" NOC\\'s Mr. Bengdara said. The Libyan state-owned company is expected to soon sign a $1 billion agreement with Halliburton that will allow the U.S. firm to rebuild the al-Dhara oil field, according to Mr. Bengdara. The oil field in central Libya was destroyed by Islamic State militants in 2015 and is now run by ConocoPhillips and TotalEnergies SE, Mr. Bengdara said. It would be one of the biggest deals for the U.S. oil-services giant clinched in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years. Halliburton and Total didn\\'t respond to requests for comment. ConocoPhillips declined to comment. Libya\\'s NOC and Honeywell are set to unveil a contract related to the construction of a refinery in southern Libya, Mr. Bengdara and a spokesman for the American firm said. The initial deal, expected to be announced this weekend, is for the design of the plant, the spokesman said, which would be followed by a $400 million pact to build the entire plant. Libya relies heavily on its oil resources for income, although it has struggled for years to turn its own crude into motor fuel, making it largely dependent on costly gasoline imports. As of last year, the North African nation was divided politically again, with a United Nations-appointed prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, remaining in control of the capital Tripoli and a rival prime minister taking charge of the country\\'s east. The country is again pushing to hold presidential and legislative elections this year, after plans fell through in 2021. Still, there have been no serious clashes since last summer and its eastern government in recent months has unlocked some of the budget needed by the state oil company to clinch deals with international companies. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a senate committee on Wednesday that the U.S. was actively working to reopen an embassy in Libya, in part so it could better support the prospect of Libyan elections. The U.S. shut its embassy in Tripoli in 2014 following violent clashes between militias. The U.S. also pressured a top Libyan commander in mid-January to expel Russia\\'s paramiliatry Wagner Group , the Journal reported last month, amid fears the unit may tap into the country\\'s oil riches. Khalifa Haftar, commander of a faction that controls eastern Libya , is aligned with the government in Tripoli . \"There is recognition in the U.S. that Libya is a workable environment,\" said Mr. Porter, who advises U.S. oil companies in the region. He added that firms now see it as \"an environment in which you can operate reasonably safely, where you can more predictably invest in ways that you could not have a few years ago.\" NOC exports most of its gas to Europe through a pipeline from Libya to Italy. Over the next three to five years, it aims to increase oil production to 2 million barrels a day, from around 1.2 million currently, and to produce 4 billion standard cubic feet of gas a day, up from roughly 2.6 billion. In January, NOC and Eni, which produces the majority of the country\\'s gas, signed an $8 billion deal for the Italian energy giant to develop two gas fields to pump 850 million cubic feet a day for 25 years. Under the agreement, production of gas will start in 2025, ramping up to full capacity of 850 million cubic feet a day by 2026. In Algeria, Eni is aiming to export an additional 3 billion cubic meters of gas annually, starting this year, to help make up for gas that used to flow from Russia. Algeria will become the firm\\'s top region for investment in the next four years. \"Algeria is a reliable partner of absolute strategic importance,\" said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during a visit to Algiers in January. From Egypt, Eni aims to export three billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Italy starting this year, after regas capacity was built up on the receiving end. That compares with roughly 1 billion cubic meters being exported last year. Egypt\\'s ability to export gas is limited given the growing electricity demand of its more than 100 million population. It doesn\\'t have any pipelines to Europe. Still, the country has ambitions to become a hub for energy distribution in the Mediterranean, importing more gas from Israel and exporting liquefied gas on ships to Italy.

Write to Chao Deng at chao.deng@wsj.com and Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com', 'GARDEN CITY, Kan. -- Southwest Kansas officials have long pushed a moonshot aqueduct project to send Missouri River water across the state to their region, where a $12.5 billion agricultural economy relies on a dwindling underground aquifer. While the effort has been dismissed as legally impossible and expensive, the persistence of the idea demonstrates how drought and a steadily shrinking water supply have created broad consensus that water policies need to be overhauled. In Kansas, where federal data shows that nearly every county was experiencing some level of drought at the end of 2022, water is among the most urgent issues facing the state legislature this year. \"Water has a certain value,\" said Clay Scott, a Ulysses, Kan., farmer and one of the aqueduct\\'s proponents. \"Every year it just continues to climb.\" Projects that move water have been used to fuel development or to irrigate crops in Western states such as Arizona and California. The Kansas aqueduct would be farther east -- reflecting spreading concern about the scarcity of water amid a changing climate and growing population centers. Similar projects are being discussed elsewhere. A groundwater-conservation district in Texas is interested in studying water-transportation projects, including a version of the Kansas aqueduct route extended to Texas, said district manager Steve Walthour. Some arid states have looked east to boost limited water supplies. The Arizona state legislature in 2021 asked Congress to study a plan to transport Mississippi River floodwaters to the Colorado River, upon which seven states including Arizona rely. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers first assessed the feasibility for a Kansas aqueduct in 1982, as part of a federal study looking at ways to supplement the Ogallala Aquifer, the region\\'s critical source of groundwater. A 2015 update of the study estimated it would cost between $5 billion and $20 billion to build the concrete-lined canal system and up to $522 million in annual energy costs to pump the water uphill to its terminal reservoir in western Kansas. Proponents of the Kansas aqueduct say it is needed to sustain the economy of the state\\'s southwest and could sell water to other Western areas that have already taken extreme measures to conserve water or find new water sources. Without a means to augment the region\\'s underground reserves, \"we will continue to dry up the infrastructure for feed yards and dairies and grain elevators and cotton gins,\" said Mr. Scott, who is a member ofthe board for the Southwest Kansas Groundwater Management District. Opponents say the idea is too expensive, and would need to fend off a likely onslaught of lawsuits from states along the Missouri River or landowners whose property would be used to build a canal system. \"The legal, economic, physical and regulatory hurdles this thing faces are virtually infinite,\" said Burke Griggs, a law professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., who is an expert in water law and who previously represented Kansas in federal and interstate water issues. \"There\\'s no way this will ever be built.\" Even those who have taken no position on an aqueduct say much of the aquifer could run dry before the project is complete. \"By the time you got done with studying, planning, litigating, constructing,\" said Connie Owen, who heads the Kansas Water Office, an agency that writes the state\\'s water plan, \"it is too late.\" The Ogallala Aquifer lies under parts of eight central U.S. states, running from South Dakota to Texas. It adds $3.8 billion to the value of the land in western Kansas, one 2022 study found. Blake Brownie Wilson, with the Kansas Geological Survey, says 80% to 90% of the aquifer\\'s water in Kansas goes to irrigation. In some parts of southwest Kansas, the aquifer has dropped more than 100 feet since it began being mined. About 30% of it had been pumped as of 2013. An additional 39% was expected to be gone by 2063 given current rates of use. In December, aboard in the Kansas Water Office recommended that the state stop its policy of slowly draining the aquifer. \"Planned depletion was the operative approach,\" Ms. Owen said. \"It still is.\" Recent drought has increased pressure on the aquifer\\'s use. Groundwater levels fell nearly 3 feet in southwest Kansas, which is experiencing the most intense and widespread drought nationwide. Less than an inch of rainfall typically seeps into the aquifer to recharge it each year. The groundwater district that manages water use in southwest Kansas thinks conserving water is appropriate but not enough. Officials in the district have been the primary proponents of the aqueduct plan in Kansas. The project remains a long shot. Kansas lawmakers this year are focused on bills aimed at promoting conservation and dedicating tax revenue to water projects. Proponents say it is the right time to look into an aqueduct because of how long it would take to be built. \"We can\\'t afford to wait any longer,\" said Mr. Scott.', 'WASHINGTON -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 Republican presidential candidate, sought to qualify his controversial remark that Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine was a \"territorial dispute.\" \"Well, I think it\\'s been mischaracterized,\" he told broadcaster Piers Morgan for an interview to be shown Thursday on the streaming service Fox Nation. Mr. Morgan included the comments in a column Wednesday for The New York Post. \"Obviously, Russia invaded. That was wrong,\" Mr. DeSantis said, according to the column. \"They invaded Crimea and took that in 2014. That was wrong.\" He added, \"What I\\'m referring to is where the fighting is going on now which is that eastern border region Donbas, and then Crimea, and you have a situation where Russia has had that. I don\\'t think legitimately but they had . . . . so it wasn\\'t that I thought Russia had a right to that.\" Mr. DeSantis said last week that the U.S. shouldn\\'t necessarily help defend Ukraine against Russia\\'s invasion and should instead focus resources on issues closer to home. It aligned him with the position of former President Donald Trump and some conservatives who have increasingly questioned thetens of billions the U.S. has provided in security assistance to Ukraine. \"While the U.S. has many vital national interests -- securing our borders, addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy security and independence, and checking the economic, cultural, and military power of the Chinese Communist Party -- becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them,\" Mr. DeSantis had said in a statement broadcast on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" on Fox News.', 'Kassie Meiler endured six hours in an online waiting room to score tickets to one of Taylor Swift\\'s coming concerts. Now, she is gearing up -- literally -- for the stamina test of the pop star\\'s 44-song, three-hour show. Instead of heels, the 27-year-old plans to wear platform Keds, the sneaker brand Ms. Swift once endorsed. Rather than a sparkly fringe jacket similar to what Ms. Swift sports onstage, Ms. Meiler is seeking a cooler option for the April show in Tampa, Fla., that she will attend, perhaps in vest form. She will swap her usual cocktail or white wine for an electrolyte drink, she said. Mentally, Ms. Meiler is pulling confidence from the 24-hour dance marathons she completed in college: \"If I can do that, I can do a Taylor Swift tour.\" Ms. Swift stunned fans opening night on her first tour in five years by performing a 190-minute set that followed two opening acts. Word spread quickly online of the stadium show\\'s length, prompting nervous strategy brainstorms among fans now rethinking everything from their elaborate outfits to hydration methods. The Eras Tour, which is scheduled to run 52 stadium dates, is forecast to become the highest-grossing tour of all time, according to concert-data tracker Pollstar. The show is a combination of Ms. Swift\\'s pandemic pursuits and her efforts to take ownership of her life\\'s work by rerecording her early music. After her festival-style shows for her 2019 \"Lover\" album were canceled because of Covid-19, she released two surprise albums penned in pandemic isolation. The Eras Tour set list spans her entire catalog, including songs from \"Folklore,\" which won the Grammy for Album of the Year and \"Evermore,\" which earned a Grammy nomination -- as well as hits that she rerecorded from \"Fearless\" and \"Red.\" Late last year, she released \"Midnights,\" which shattered sales records. Packing so much material into one show amounts to an endurance test for Ms. Swift, too. Her 44-song set dwarfs that of other rock stars known for long shows, according to data from Setlist.fm. Prince\\'s 2004 shows and Beyonce\\'s 2018 Coachella sets each averaged 32 songs. Bruce Springsteen averaged 29 songs in 1985 and 27 in 2012. Bob Dylan\\'s 1978 world tour averaged 28 songs, according to Setlist.fm. Stadium shows are a badge of honor for music\\'s biggest stars. Only an elite few can fill them, and on this tour Ms. Swift has sold out multiple nights in each city she visits. Her Homeric effort, which includes the 10-minute version of fan-favorite song \"All Too Well,\" is baffling fans and industry insiders. \"Sure, Springsteen and Prince played these legendary long shows, but they were not singing the entire time. They had bands, and a whole lot of instrumental work that extended out the show,\" said Nathan Hubbard, former Ticketmaster chief executive and co-host of the Ringer\\'s \"Every Single Album: Taylor Swift\" podcast series. \"Taylor is singing as the center lead for the entirety of the show, and she\\'s doing it in heels,\" he said. A representative for Ms. Swift didn\\'t respond to a request for comment. In addition to singing and dancing, Ms. Swift flies, runs, climbs and, yes, even dives around the stadium -- in a series of custom Christian Louboutins. \"Three-hour shows. @taylorswift is definitely a distance swimmer,\" Olympic gold-medalist swimmer Katie Ledecky tweeted Tuesday. Mr. Hubbard estimated that if Ms. Swift\\'s movements were tracked as soccer players were during the World Cup, she travels a mile during the show, maybe two. Former NFL defensive end J.J. Watt lauded Ms. Swift\\'s rigor in a 2 1/2-minute video posted to Twitter after seeing her Saturday show in Glendale, Ariz. \"She did not stop the whole time -- there was no halftime, there was no TV timeouts,\" he said. \"She crushed it, and she didn\\'t even look tired. I was tired, and I was just sitting there.\" Daniela Morgan, 40, is doubling up on Las Vegas shows this weekend. On Friday night, she is attending solo with a $760 standing-room-only floor ticket. For Saturday night, She initially planned to take a friend, but her 10-year-old son, Eli, begged to go instead. Eli has heard reminders from his dad about the responsibility that comes with taking a $350 ticket to see his mom\\'s favorite artist, Ms. Morgan said. \"Is my kid going to be able to hang three hours?\" she said. Claire Ginther, a 26-year-old from Huntington Beach, Calif., has a shoe dilemma. To see Ms. Swift in Las Vegas this weekend, she had planned an outfit based on the pastel, 1960s aesthetic of Ms. Swift\\'s \"Lover\" album. Her new go-go boots arrived this week, but now she is debating switching to sneakers for comfort. With her 5\\'1\" height and $750 floor tickets, she risks not being able to see much, she said. For advice, she is combing through TikTok, where concertgoers are trading survival tips. \"You\\'d think people are talking about running the L.A. Marathon,\" she said. \"They\\'re talking about going to see Taylor Swift.\" Meanwhile, Ms. Ginther wonders about Ms. Swift\\'s stamina lasting until the tour\\'s closing shows in Los Angeles in August, for which Ms. Ginther said she paid $100 for a nosebleed seat. \"Is she just going to be crawling to the finish line when she gets to L.A.?\" For an April show in Texas, Catherine Frisina, 33, plans to hydrate sparingly with Liquid I.V., a powder that is mixed with water and promises an energy boost. \"If Taylor doesn\\'t need a bathroom break neither do I,\" she said. Andrea Alfano, who fueled up with pizza for back-to-back concerts on the tour\\'s opening weekend, said making it through the actual show isn\\'t the hardest part. \"The adrenaline of being there carries you through the show itself,\" the 26-year-old daycare teacher said. It was after the show in Glendale -- facing an hourslong wait for an Uber -- when she realized she was tired and her cowboy-boot-clad feet hurt. \"The hardest part is getting out of the stadium.\" At three hours, Rob Dobyns said his favorite part about Ms. Swift\\'s coming show in Kansas City is that his wife and three teen daughters are going and he isn\\'t. The 45-year-old prefers \\'90s Seattle grunge bands but calls himself a Taylor Swift fan by proxy. \"I couldn\\'t tell you the name of any songs but as they\\'re constantly screamed throughout the house, I could probably sing along to several.\" His wife, whom he calls \"the hype man for our family,\" will make the three-hour trek from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Kansas City, Mo., where the four of them will stay in a hote. Back home, Mr. Dobyns, a retired cop turned software engineer, has plans for a marathon of his own: scary movies, beer and steaks for himself and the dog.', 'TORONTO -- Multinational companies are pumping billions of dollars into Canada\\'s electric-vehicle manufacturing sector, lured by government incentives, access to raw materials and cheap renewable energy. In the latest sign of interest in the country, German auto maker Volkswagen Group last week said it had chosen a site in the province of Ontario to build its first battery-cell plant outside Europe. A company spokesman declined to provide specifics about the investment, but Canada\\'s industry minister said the investment, in the town of St. Thomas, 120 miles northeast of Detroit, could rank as the largest ever made in Canada\\'s auto sector. \"This is a big moment for Canada,\" said Francois-Philippe Champagne, Canada\\'s minister of innovation, science and industry, about the many investments. Volkswagen cited Canada\\'s natural resources as one of the reasons for choosing Ontario. \"Canada offers ideal conditions, including the local supply of raw materials and wide access to clean electricity,\" the company said. Volkswagen\\'s planned factory follows recent electric-vehicle and battery-making project investments by General Motors Co., Stellantis NV, French tire maker Michelin NV, Brazilian miner Vale, its U.K.-based rival Rio Tinto PLC, and German chemicals company BASF SE, among others. Canada is benefiting from a push by the U.S. and its allies to reduce their dependence on China for the critical minerals used in electric-vehicle batteries and military equipment. Companies announced more than $11 billion in investments in electric-vehicle-related projects in Canada last year, according to a tally of company announcements. The U.S., which has an economy that is 12 times as large as Canada\\'s, recorded $38.9 billion of similar investments in 2022, according to the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan-based nonprofit. In one example, Stellantis and South Korea\\'s LG Energy Solution are building a $4.1 billion battery plant in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river from Detroit. The joint venture, named NextStar Energy Inc., broke ground on the factory late last year and could employ 2,500 workers when it becomes operational in 2024, Stellantis said. Canada has had to pay up to win the investments, scrambling to keep up with the U.S., which has unveiled a raft of subsidies and tax breaks meant to draw capital investment in the EV industry. In the case of the NextStar project, Canada\\'s federal government and the province of Ontario gave more than one billion Canadian dollars, equivalent to $732 million, to the joint venture, said people with knowledge of the transaction. The Canadian government has also contributed money to investments by Rio Tinto, Honda Canada Inc., GM and others. The new investments, many of which are still in the early stages, come amid a decadeslong decline in the Canadian auto industry. Canada is among the most expensive countries in the world to build cars and the highest-cost market for car assembly in the North American free-trade zone. To save money, auto makers in recent decades moved thousands of manufacturing jobs and motor-vehicle assembly capacity to Mexico. At its peak in 1999, Canadian auto production surpassed three million vehicles and employed more than 175,000 people, according to the Trillium Network for Advanced Manufacturing, a nonprofit. Last year, the local industry produced 1.2 million vehicles and employed 110,000 people. It is unclear whether the new investments will reverse the declining trend, said Greig Mordue, an associate processor at the University of McMaster\\'s W. Booth School of Engineering Practice and Technology. Making batteries and electric vehicles needs fewer people than assembling internal-combustion-engine cars, he said, and the amount of money invested using taxpayer funds could limit the economic benefit. \"Until we know how much we paid for this, I\\'ll reserve my judgment on how good a deal this is,\" said Mr. Mordue, in reference to the Volkswagen deal. Mr. Champagne declined to disclose the value of subsidies and incentives that the government offered Volkswagen. He said the long-term benefits to the Canadian economy from the new projects justify the government\\'s investments.', 'WASHINGTON -- TikTok launched a battalion of influencers in the nation\\'s capital Wednesday to send a message to Congress: Banning the app would be met with widespread popular opposition. \"TikTok is not a children\\'s dancing app,\" said Aidan Kohn-Murphy, a college freshman with close to 300,000 TikTok followers and founder of the advocacy group Gen-Z for Change. \"It is one of the most powerful tools that young people have to engage each other and to get civically involved.\" Mr. Kohn-Murphy was one of more than 20 TikTok personalities with wide followings who traveled to the capital this week at the company\\'s invitation to lobby lawmakers and others in advance of TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew\\'s appearance before a House committee on Thursday. The influencers\\' blitz is part of TikTok\\'s response to persistent concerns among U.S. officials that the app, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., could be used by the Chinese government to spy on Americans or promote divisive or manipulative content. The Biden administration recently demanded that TikTok\\'s Chinese owners sell their stakes in the company or face a possible U.S. ban of the app, and members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee are expected to question Mr. Chew about the security concerns and other issues. TikTok maintains that it isn\\'t beholden to any government and is a vital platform for 150 million American users -- a theme the influencers worked to underscore in a meeting with journalists near the Capitol on Wednesday. \"It would be difficult to be able to support a candidate that would take away something that is so integral to the direction we\\'re going as a society,\" said Baedri Nichole, a bakery owner from Columbus, Ohio, whose \"hot cocoa bomb\" confection is a hit on TikTok. Kenny Jary, an 81-year-old retiree known on TikTok as Patriotic Kenny, said he uses the app to raise money to buy mobility scooters for fellow veterans. Others said the app provided a platform to launch small businesses or discuss topics such as eldercare and mental health. TikTok covered the group\\'s travel and accommodation expenses. The company bused the influencers on Wednesday to the Capitol grounds, where they gathered on a scenic rooftop to shoot their own videos and stand for journalists\\' interviews. After threats of banning the app started during the Trump administration, the company has spent recent years building a U.S.-based security apparatus to wall off U.S. user data and give officials the ability to inspect the computer code that recommends a steady feed of videos to users. TikTok stars were a crucial factor in the company\\'s successful effort to fight off a proposed ban during the Trump years. Whether they will have the same influence this time around remains to be seen. \"I\\'m aware of the popularity of the platform. I\\'m not oblivious,\" said Rep. Yvette Clarke (D., N.Y.), a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee who hasn\\'t yet taken a position on a potential ban. \"However, it\\'s important to weigh our equities here. National security has to be addressed.\" Ahead of Mr. Chew\\'s appearance, TikTok has ramped up lobbying efforts with the help of Oracle Corp., its U.S. data-security partner. Advertisements at the capital\\'s Metro subway stops tout the company\\'s commitment to user safety.', 'The most memorable event of the 2023 baseball season took place on Tuesday night, over a week before the MLB regular season is set to begin. With a full count and two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning of a one-run game, Los Angeles Angels superstar Shohei Ohtani stood on the mound in Miami and faced his Angels teammate, Mike Trout. It was the U.S. against Japan in the title game of the World Baseball Classic. But it was also the marquee moment baseball fans have been hoping to see since Ohtani made his MLB debut in 2018: The two greatest baseball players in the world, performing in a high-leverage moment in a championship game. The twist was that they were opponents, not teammates. \"The baseball world won tonight,\" said Team USA manager Mark DeRosa after Japan\\'s 3-2 victory in the final. Ohtani didn\\'t spare Trout in his effort to close out the victory for Japan. He set up the at-bat with a sweeping slider, then fired off four consecutive fastballs to Trout, all around 100 miles per hour or faster. Ohtani struck Trout out swinging on another sweeping slider, ending the game, the tournament, and setting up quite a scenario in the Angels clubhouse when the two report back to spring training this week. \"This was probably the funnest 10 days I\\'ve ever had,\" Trout said after the game. As a member of the Angels, he has only appeared briefly in the MLB playoffs once. Ohtani hasn\\'t appeared in the playoffs at all. Ohtani won the battle against Trout, but the two typically stolid superstars spent the tournament showing big emotions as they each worked their way toward that final at-bat. Trout was the first to reach base against Japan, legging out a first-inning double and giving an emphatic salute as he found himself safe. Ohtani was the engine of Team Japan, delivering a pregame speech to his teammates in the clubhouse before the final game of the tournament. The two players have to this point spent their MLB careers mostly languishing in Anaheim, with the chance to compete for a championship maddeningly out of reach. In this matchup, Trout and Ohtani weren\\'t just given the opportunities to experience baseball on a big stage. They were clear leaders for their respective teams. The chance to see the longtime teammates face off against one another represented the best that international baseball has to offer. \"This is the greatest game in the world,\" Angels manager Phil Nevin said after watching his star players from Arizona. \"No other sport can bring drama like baseball.\" Earlier in the tournament, it was expected that Ohtani would pitch in a quarterfinals game then return to spring training to make an exhibition start to line him up for opening day. When Japan reached the WBC final, the Angels authorized him to depart from his typical routine to be available to pitch against the U.S. Now, he closed out the tournament and won its MVP, and is still on track to take the ball on Angels opening day. This year\\'s WBC turned out to be a massive success for MLB -- even accounting for major injuries to Mets closer Edwin Diaz (out for the season with a knee injury) and Astros second baseman Jose Altuve (broken thumb after being hit by a pitch). They were reminders of the risk of playing full-effort games in March. The tournament turned out to have high-energy, competitive games, and the final matchup of USA-Japan was undoubtedly a pairing of baseball powerhouses. The WBC will return in 2026, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred told reporters in Miami on Tuesday. \"The World Series is always gonna be the World Series,\" Manfred said. \"This is a different kind of competition. We do it to grow the game and internationalize the game.\" Ohtani was named the tournament\\'s MVP after hitting .435, with a .606 on base percentage and a .739 slugging percentage in seven games for Japan. He also had a 1.86 ERA in three appearances -- two starts and his appearance as the closer in the final. The tournament furthered his status as an international spectacle, and he wept on the field as he lined up with the rest of Team Japan to be honored during the trophy ceremony. Ohtani and Trout, along with Team Mexico pitcher Patrick Sandoval, will return to the Angels clubhouse with plenty of material for trash talking and an early-season taste of championship excitement. Whether the experience will benefit the Angels remains to be seen. They still face tough competition this season, particularly against the defending champion Astros in the American League West. MLB\\'s regular season begins a week from Thursday, and players who faced one another in the WBC will be reunited as teammates for the long season marathon. For years, baseball wanted to see Ohtani and Trout playing on a big stage. They got there as opponents, but the next step for their careers will be getting there as teammates.', 'WASHINGTON -- TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Zi Chew has navigated both Western and Chinese business over the course of his fast rise to the corner office. That cultural straddle has helped land him the top job at one of the world\\'s biggest tech companies. His background may now help him connect with a skeptical American Congress. Many members have threatened to ban TikTok, saying its Chinese ownership poses a national-security threat. On Thursday, the 40-year-old Singaporean Army reservist and former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker is slated to appear before a House panel to argue against a ban and reassure Americans their data are safe and Beijing won\\'t be able to influence what viewers see on TikTok. Born and raised in Singapore, then educated in London and at Harvard Business School, Mr. Chew spent some of his early career cutting deals for a venture-capital firm in Asia. He then quickly moved to the C-suite as the chief financial officer of a Chinese smartphone giant at age 32. He runs TikTok from offices in Singapore but travels often, including frequently to the U.S. He met his wife, a Taiwanese-American who grew up in Bethesda, Md., at Harvard. Relatively unknown for the boss of one of the world\\'s mostpopular apps, Mr. Chew will be asked to defend the company in front of some of its more skeptical critics on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Aides to the Republicans who control the committee say there is essentially nothing Mr. Chew can saythat would change their mindsas they threaten a nationwideban. In an interview from the company\\'s WeWork offices in Washington, he said he views Thursday\\'s hearing as a chance to explain what TikTok is trying to do and to get feedback from Congress members -- not a last-gasp effort to save TikTok\\'sAmerican business. \"I look at it as an opportunity to do that, not a do-or-die\" moment, he said. The corporate stakes for Mr. Chew are as high as they get for a CEO facing such an appearance in Washington. Some Congress members from both major parties are pushing for a nationwide ban of the video app, citing national-security threats. The Biden administration isdemanding TikTok divestitself from its Chinese parent, ByteDance Ltd., or face such a ban. Critics say China could force TikTok to hand over American user data or influence what American viewers see on the app. TikTok has said it has never received such a request and would refuse to comply with one. Mr. Chew took over the top job afterKevin Mayer,a high-profile Walt Disney Co. alum, left his post after three months, while the Trump administration pursued an earlier effort to force a sale of TikTok to U.S. investors. He is a native English speaker who, like most Singaporeans, is of Chinese ancestry. His father worked in construction and his mother in bookkeeping. He said he was uprooted from a modest upbringing at age 12, when high marks on a national exam sent him to an elite high school. Mr. Chew was put on an officer track during his mandatory 2 1/2 years of military service. That added 10 years to his eligibility for reserve duty, which ends when he is 50. The hardest physical experience of his life, he said, was the military\\'s five-day survival course in Brunei\\'s jungles. He built a hut, cooked wild yams and trekked 55 miles. At one point during such courses, trainees are given a live quail that they can kill with their hands before skinning and cooking it. In the interview, Mr. Chew didn\\'t want to discuss what he did with his bird. After the military, Mr. Chew attended University College London and remained in the British capital to work as a banker for Goldman Sachs. Following an internship at Meta Platforms Inc.\\'s Facebook and business school, Mr. Chew worked for venture-capital firm DST Global. His high-school-level Mandarin qualified him to be its China-focused partner. In 2012, he visited the Chinese equivalent of a Silicon Valley garage: an apartment in Beijing\\'s university district. Thirty people, including a chef, crammed in to develop an app that suggested news articles to people based on factors such as how much time they spent on previous stories. The company was ByteDance, which would go on to create TikTok. Its founder, Zhang Yiming, won over Mr. Chew. He and his partners invested in the company. \"The idea is so simple but so powerful: that you should be looking at content not based on who you know, but really based on your own behavior,\" Mr. Chew said. Another investment Mr. Chew led was in Xiaomi Corp., a Chinese smartphone giant with global ambitions. Xiaomi brought him over first as chief financial officer and then had him run its business outside China.']\n"
