# Machine Learning-Based Roboadvisor 

This project employs a cutting-edge wealth management application, uniquely designed to harness the power of machine learning for financial prediction and analysis (FP&A). At its core, the app implements a custom-built machine learning model that specializes in analyzing and predicting the performance of sector-focused stock market Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).

Our goal in developing this project is to provide a robust, free online tool for any level of investor or stock market enthusiast to bring additional transparency and understanding to underrepresented participants and enthusiasts of the financial sector. 

We strive to minimize the use of black-box algorithms, ensuring that our users have a clear understanding of how predictions and analyses are generated. Transparency is a key tenet of our project, and we aim to make both our data references and the inner workings of our models as accessible, understandable, and modular as possible.
